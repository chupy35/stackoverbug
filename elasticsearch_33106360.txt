Retrieve data after deleting mapping in Elastic Search
<p>I am fairly new to elastic search. Just this weekend I started trying out stuff in it, and while I think it's a pretty neat way to store documents, I came across the following problem. I was fooling around a bit with the mappings (without actually knowing at the time what they were and what they were for), and I accidentally deleted the mapping of my index, along with all the data stored by performing a </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>DELETE tst_environment/object/_mapping &#xA;{&#xA;   "properties" : {&#xA;   "title" : { "type": "string" }&#xA;   }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there any way to retrieve the lost data or am I, well .. fucked? Any information regarding the issue is more than welcome :)</p>&#xA;
<p>Unless you have taken a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html#modules-snapshots" rel="nofollow">snapshot</a> of the index it is not possbile to retrieve the data once you deleted the mapping. &#xA;You would have to reindex the data from initial source</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>FWIW the upcoming  V2.0 of elasticsearch does not allow one to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/_mapping_changes.html#_types_may_no_longer_be_deleted" rel="nofollow">delete mappings</a> . </p>&#xA;
