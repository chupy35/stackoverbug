Try to understand getIndexCurrent() function in ElasticSearch
<p>I'm new to ElasticSearch, and trying to understand what does <a href="http://xbib.org/elasticsearch/1.5.1/apidocs/org/elasticsearch/index/indexing/IndexingStats.Stats.html#getIndexCurrent--" rel="nofollow noreferrer">getIndexCurrent()</a> function mean. Based on this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_monitoring_individual_nodes.html?q=monitoring" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ElasticSearch tutorial</a>, it means the number of docs currently being indexed?</p>&#xA;
<p>That's correct, <code>index_current</code> is the total number of docs currently being indexed. It is different than the <code>index_total</code> figure which is an increasing counter of how many indexing operations have taken place in that index. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the below example, we see that the index currently contains 99 documents.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>"indexing": {&#xA;      "index_total": 803441,&#xA;      "index_time_in_millis": 367654,&#xA;      "index_current": 99,&#xA;      "delete_total": 0,&#xA;      "delete_time_in_millis": 0,&#xA;      "delete_current": 0&#xA;},&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
