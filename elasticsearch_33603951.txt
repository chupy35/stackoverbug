Elasticsearch: Dynamic change of node configuration settings
<p>I know there is an API to change cluster wide settings in a transient and persistent way. But I need to add a tag on a single node without restarting the node. To be more precise, in addition to introducing a new tag  <code>node.storage_type = value</code> in <code>elasticsearch.yaml</code>, I want to add it through the REST API. Otherwise, the restart of the cluster node by node takes too long.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The nodes info API is a read-only API and does not allow PUT requests. So, does anbody know any way how to solve it?</p>&#xA;
<p>I am afraid there is nothing to update Node Settings using the REST API (except Cluster Settings and Index Settings). There was a plugin to <a href="https://github.com/yakaz/elasticsearch-action-reloadsettings" rel="nofollow">reload config files</a>, but it looks unmaintained and installing this plugin would require a node restart.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are some things you can do speed node restart though:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code># Disable allocation during restart&#xA;PUT /_cluster/settings&#xA;{&#xA;    "transient" : {&#xA;        "cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "none"&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;# Synced flush&#xA;POST /_flush/synced&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
