Stopwords in term aggregation
<p>I want to filter the stop words from the term aggregation, so I defined an analyzer with a custom stop word list (around 1000 words) and applied it to my index.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I query the index to do a term aggregation I get a result where the stopwords are dominating the result.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tested the analyzer with</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="http://192.168.1.37:9200/myindex/_analyze?analyzer=custom_analyzer" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.1.37:9200/myindex/_analyze?analyzer=custom_analyzer</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And the analyzer seems to work as it should. &#xA;But in the term aggregation the stopwords are still shown.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Did I forget something?!</p>&#xA;
