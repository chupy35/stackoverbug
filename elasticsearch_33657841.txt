Elasticsearch Not Responding to Certain API Calls / Kibana and Head not loading
<p>I have an elasticsearch cluster running 1.2.2 with head and Kibana 3.1.2 installed.  When i load Kibana in my browser, the header of the page loads, but not the body of the default page.  If I attempt to open an existing dashboard, I see the list of saved dashboards, but cannot get one to load.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The Head plugin also will not load.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The /_cat/health returns promptly with cluster status of green.&#xA;The /_cat/nodes just hangs up and will not return.&#xA;Other calls to the api such as an -XDELETE hangs, while an -XGET will return data.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have had this issue before and it mysteriously resolves itself.  I have been unable to find a root cause.  Has anyone experienced this and found cause? </p>&#xA;
<p>Stopping the dedicated master nodes and the dedicated client node at the same time, and then bringing them back up seems to have solved this issue.  A rolling restart of the masters and client was not effective.</p>&#xA;
