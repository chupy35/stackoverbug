what is the role of elected master elasticsearch (ELK Stack)
<ol>&#xA;<li><p>What is the main purpose of elected master in ELK. If elected master to have only node.master enabled, node.data disabled and not allowed to take any searching and indexing requests. </p></li>&#xA;<li><p>I have 3 node cluster in which 1 is elected master. If I have kibana as front end UI for querying data and logstash sending data to the cluster for indexing (for realtime log analysis) , Is it a good idea to send searching/indexing requests to other 2 master nodes apart from elected master. or select 1 node for searching or another node for indexing leaving elected master untouched. Please advice. </p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please suggest me what would be the best plan </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Plan A</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BevKe.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>or </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Plan B</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kphJ2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>or Plan C</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6kj7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>&#xA;
<p>Elected master is a node elected between data nodes and the function of master is to maintain cluster state. Cluster state is the data which Has information on the entire cluster . What nodes are present , what indices are present and which shards are in which nodes etc are stored in cluster state , though only master is allowed to make any changes to cluster state , every node will have a copy of it. This removes single dependency of master and make it possible for any node to become master. &#xA;Now as the function of master is thin , it doesn't make sense to have dedicated masters until and unless you have crazy number of nodes. </p>&#xA;
