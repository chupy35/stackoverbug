How to view the response for multiple indices for a single query
<p>I have created multiple indices in elasticsearch and have passed a single query to all of them. Is there any way to know,how many results came from each index?&#xA;Here is the screenshot of my elasticsearch head,showing a single aggregation applied to two indices</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>screenshot:&#xA;<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sWRBk.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here as in the figure you can see I have done an aggregation named "posted_time" on the indices foodfind and comics (red box 1).&#xA;But in the response window,to the right,only the results for the index "comics" is shown. How can I see the results for the other index too? </p>&#xA;
<p>You can use terms aggregation on the field _index for this.&#xA;Lets say you need to run the same on index-a , index-b and index-c.&#xA;You need to make the request in this pattern - </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/index-a,index-b,index-c/_search' -d '{&#xA;    "aggs" : {&#xA;       "indexStats" : {&#xA;             "terms" : {&#xA;                 "field" : "_index"&#xA;             }&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}'&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
