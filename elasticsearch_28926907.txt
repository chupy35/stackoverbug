How to handle url change when a node dies?
<p>I am new to elasticsearch. I have a cluster with 3 nodes on a same machine. To access each node I have separate url as the port changes(localhost:9200, localhost:9201, localhost:9202).<br>&#xA;<br>&#xA;Now the question I have is that suppose my node 1(i.e. master node) dies then elasticsearch engine handle the situation very well and makes node 2 as master node but how does my application know that a node died and now I need to hit node 2 with port 9201?<br>&#xA;<br>&#xA;Is there a way using which I always hit a single URL and internally it figures out which node to hit?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks,<br>&#xA;Pratz</p>&#xA;
<p>The client search nodes with a discovery module. The name of the cluster in your clients configuration is important to get this working.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With a correct configuration (on client and cluster) you can bring a single node down without any (negative) effect on your client. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>See the following links:&#xA;<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery.html</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery-zen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery-zen.html</a></p>&#xA;
