Is there a limit of the number of aliases (globally and/or per index) in elasticsearch?
<p>I'm starting to study elasticsearch for my project. &#xA;Specifically version 1.5.&#xA;I'm considering using aliases to abstract client apps from the intricacies of index setup.&#xA;I might end up with 20 to 50 indexes and 10 to 30 aliases per indexes.&#xA;This would amount to 1500 aliases.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I wonder if there is a limit in the number of aliases per indexes and or per cluster.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks in advance,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>P.</p>&#xA;
<p>In Elasticsearch source code I see aliases are referenced as <code>String[]</code>. And arrays in Java <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3038392/do-java-arrays-have-a-maximum-size">seem to have quite a large size</a> and I wouldn't worry about 1500 aliases :-).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I would worry about, though, is the cluster state. Elasticsearch nodes share between them the entire cluster state which contains all the mappings, all the aliases, templates etc. A large cluster state means more data to be moved around on the network and more time to process/ingest the updated cluster state. 1500 aliases doesn't sound too bad.</p>&#xA;
