How to return term scores in elasticsearch?
<p>How do I get the term vector for an indexed document in elasticsearch?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>That is, once I have uploaded several documents to my elasticsearch index, I would like to get the scored term vectors back so that I can see which which terms are over indexed for a given document and thus for a document show the most influential terms. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this possible?</p>&#xA;
<p>You can achieve that using the Term Vectors API: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-termvectors.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-termvectors.html</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Say you already indexed several documents. Then it's possible to get the term vectors using the following API call:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/&lt;id&gt;/_termvectors?pretty=true'&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Just replace &#60;id&#62; with the id of the document you want create the query for.</p>&#xA;
