Change Index Template Across Elasticsearch Cluster
<p>I'm running ES cluster with multiple on AWS. The cluster is behind an ELB that is fed by logstash. I've tested a new mapping template in a sandbox cluster, but with only one node.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've read over these two articles:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/changing-mapping-with-zero-downtime" rel="nofollow">https://www.elastic.co/blog/changing-mapping-with-zero-downtime</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When changing the template does each node need to have an updated copy? Can the new template be fed to the master and then it will share the template? </p>&#xA;
<p>You can add/update your template using the <code>_template</code> endpoint and all master-eligible nodes will record it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, if you decide to store that template <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html#config" rel="nofollow">within a file</a> (in the <code>config/templates</code> folder), then you have to store that file on all master-eligible nodes.</p>&#xA;
