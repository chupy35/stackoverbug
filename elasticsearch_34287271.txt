reindex a type on another one in ElasticSearch 2.x onward
<p>I've updated to ElasticSearch 2.1. Deleting a mapping type is not supported anymore since 2.0 onward.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Before, it was very useful to simply remove a type, and created it again.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, the question is waht should I do in order to reach it out on ElasticSearch 2.1?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Imagine I've an index <code>idx</code> with a type <code>tp</code>.&#xA;I supose I shall use <code>alias</code>, however I don't know how to do it.&#xA;Does exists <code>alias</code> for <code>index-level</code>? Does exist <code>alias</code> for <code>type-level</code>?</p>&#xA;
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34286459/4604579">my answer to your other question</a>, you can proceed in a similar way as before, just on a totally new index (which I called <code>myindex</code> below):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>First create a new index with your mapping</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>curl -XPUT localhost:9200/myindex -d '{&#xA;   "mappings": {&#xA;       "mytype": {&#xA;           "properties": {&#xA;               ...&#xA;           }&#xA;       }&#xA;   }&#xA;}'&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then re-index your data in your new index</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>curl -XPUT localhost:9200/myindex/mytype/1 -d '{"field":"value"}'&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Finally, you can run your queries on your new index <code>myindex</code>, you can also delete the previous index:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/oldindex&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
<p>Oh,since 2.x,the elasticsearch cannot delete the mapping .It is no longer possible to delete the mapping for a type. Instead you should delete the index and recreate it with the new mappings.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>[You  can refer to the link  as follow ! ]</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/indices-delete-mapping.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/indices-delete-mapping.html</a></p>&#xA;
