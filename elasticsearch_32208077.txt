Scaling Elasticsearch via large shard count
<p>I am interested in setting up an Elasticsearch cluster. Initially, there will be very few nodes (i.e. 3 nodes), but the plan is eventually to scale it up to many thousands of nodes. The documentation states that: "The number of primary shards is fixed at the moment an index is created." This means that if I start with three shards, I cannot get any advantages by adding more nodes later. Does this mean that I should create my index with 10,000 shards initially, even though I only have 3 nodes initially? This will give me the ability to scale up to 10,000 nodes, right? </p>&#xA;
