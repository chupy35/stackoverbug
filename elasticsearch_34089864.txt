<p>I landed in the same boat today and after digging around a while found that Elastic no longer supports RHEL &lt; 6. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Have a look at the Elastic matrix at <a href="https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also refer the thread <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10843" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10843</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The question is nearly a year old but I'm answering it with the hope that a fellow passerby might benefit. </p>&#xA;
