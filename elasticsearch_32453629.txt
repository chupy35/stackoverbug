Running multiple Elasticsearch production nodes in one machine
<p>Is it a recommended practice to run multiple Elasticsearch nodes in one physical (virtual) machine? I'm speaking about production environment.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I currently have three virtual machines that unicast each other. Setup:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>node.name:"VM1"&#xA;master:true&#xA;data:true&#xA;&#xA;node.name:"VM2"&#xA;master:true&#xA;data:true&#xA;&#xA;node.name:"VM3"&#xA;master:false&#xA;data:true&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There's a request to have a dedicated master node in first virtual machine (next to VM1). I'm trying to avoid that and looking for strong arguments that I shouldn't do this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please advice.</p>&#xA;
<p>Having a dedicated master makes sense in a larger environment to me. I would say if your nodes are not that busy having a data node also be a master would not be the end of the world. I would be more comfortable having 3 data nodes for high availability.</p>&#xA;
