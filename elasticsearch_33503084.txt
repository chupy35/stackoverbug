elasticsearch: apostrophe as word delimiter, with exceptions
<p>We have a multilingual environment and are having trouble matching when apostrophes are involved.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>We want a search for "can't" to match "can't".</li>&#xA;<li>We want a search for "all'acqua" in quotes to match "all'acqua".</li>&#xA;<li>But we also want a search for "acqua" to match "all'acqua".</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can we get this done?<br>&#xA;Currently, we are using an elision filter with a list of articles. That works somewhat but a search for "all'acqua" in quotes fails.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried a "word_delimiter" filter with a list of protected words (can't, won't, etc.) but that didn't work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can we get it working?</p>&#xA;
<p>I would recommend the <a href="https://github.com/yakaz/elasticsearch-analysis-combo/" rel="nofollow">combo analyzer</a>.&#xA;As only one tokenizer is allowed per analyzer , this feature is not directly possible.&#xA;But if you can put a white space tokenizer in one analyzer and standard tokenizer in another analyzer , that should do the trick.</p>&#xA;
