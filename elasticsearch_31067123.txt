Elasticsearch start failing after java upgrade
<p>I upgraded my Java version from java 6 to java 7 and restarted elasticsearch. But now its failing to start and i am not able to figure out why. The logs looks like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>[2015-06-26 12:39:12,151][INFO ][node                     ] [D'Spayre] version[1.4.0], pid[17934], build[bc94bd8/2014-11-05T14:26:12Z]&#xA;[2015-06-26 12:39:12,152][INFO ][node                     ] [D'Spayre] initializing ...&#xA;[2015-06-26 12:39:12,157][ERROR][bootstrap                ] {1.4.0}: Initialization Failed ...&#xA;- NullPointerException[null]&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Has anyone faced similar issue?</p>&#xA;
