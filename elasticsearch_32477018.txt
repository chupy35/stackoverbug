what is the suitable number of nodes in elasticsearch cluster
<p>If I configured my elasticsearch cluster with the following configuration, and I have to create about 10 indexes, what will be the suitable number of nodes I need  ? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>index.number_of_shards: 7&#xA;index.number_of_replicas: 1&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
<p>I would say that depends from how much information you receive. But that is the beauty of elasticsearch, expand a cluster is the easiest thing you have to do and it will balance itself.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you have 10 indexes, two copies of each (original+replica) and 7 shards for each, your max number of nodes will be 2*10*7=140. Your minimum should be 2 because of the number of replicas. After you do some analysis to the number of records you have and receive daily, you should be able to "guess" what the best cluster size for your system is.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Right now I have a system with 4 data nodes, that has 2 indexes per day (last 2 years), 1 replica per index and a 5shard configuration and everything works smoothly. Oh, I receive about 2 million records per day right now.</p>&#xA;
