Elasticsearch for a large searchable database
<p>I am currently looking for a database storage system which can hold my data, and make it easily searchable via PHP.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have about 65 million text files which range from a few bytes up to 10 megabytes each. Total current size is about 1,5TB of raw data.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to be able to quickly search these files, and someone pointed out that Elasticsearch could be a good candidate.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Ideally I would run this on one powerful machine with a lot of RAM, and plenty of disk storage.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know Elasticsearch uses Java. Would using/searching such a large amount of data be efficient and fast with Elasticsearch?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there maybe a better storage system that I could use instead of Elasticsearch?</p>&#xA;
<p>ES is build for searching large databases so, yes, it would likely be a good candidate.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>Ideally I would run this on one powerful machine with a lot of RAM, and plenty of disk storage.</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>ES is build as a distributed database, meaning that in a production environment it runs best on 3 or more nodes (node = server).  The more nodes you have, the faster you can insert and the faster you can search the data.  That is the "magic" of ES and other distributed databases.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my recommendation: try it out on development but plan on a <strong><em>minimum</em></strong> of 2 nodes in production, perhaps more.</p>&#xA;
