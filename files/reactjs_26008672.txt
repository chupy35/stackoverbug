Using react.js with custom native DOM events
<p>How do you access native dom events with react?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> says "If you find that you need the underlying browser event for some reason, simply use the <strong>nativeEvent</strong> attribute to get it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How do you use the nativeEvent attribute?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried onDelete={this.handleDelete} but it doesn't seem to get triggered. I can bind the event with jQuery so I know it's firing.</p>&#xA;
<p>React doesn't support custom DOM events.  You have two options:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>use a <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/events" rel="nofollow">regular event emitter</a></li>&#xA;<li>add custom event handlers using jQuery</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Either of these should be wrapped into a mixin, and don't forget to remove the listeners in componentWillUnmount.  The jQuery option is a last resort.</p>&#xA;
