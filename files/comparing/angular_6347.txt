b'ngTouch scrolling - performance problems with addClass/removeClass and using ngSwipeLeft/Right - also touch too sensitive as scrolling through list with ng-click accidentally clicks too often'
b'Sorry guys, I love the core team with this project and Angular as a whole but I have struggled with ngTouch (ngMobile before that) ever since the module was introduced. The advantages it brings are all nullified, imo, by the incredible degradation to fluid scrolling on mobile devices. \nI have found that the addClass/removeClass behavior of ng-click-active is the culprit to causing the browser to reflow, which is even noted as being something to minimize in an official google guide by Lindsey Simon: https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/reflow\n# frustratedwithngTouch\n'
