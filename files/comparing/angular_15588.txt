b'Memory leak when focusing an <input> element'
b'There seems to be a memory leak in Angular version 1.3 through to 1.5.10 when using a directive to `focus()` an input element.\r\n\r\nPlunker link:  https://plnkr.co/edit/slltOvsFsddoaO7LJJ1z\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Download the code as a zip file (running inside of Plunker seems to obscure the issue)\r\n2) Open up the index.html file and in Chrome dev tools and go to Timeline\r\n3) Start Timeline recording and then press "Hello" on the webpage. Wait for the page to cycle 200 iterations  (about 20 seconds) of reloading the controller (and leak the nodes)\r\n4) Press the Garbage Collection icon at the top of the Timeline, and stop recording. When viewing the node count graph you will see that we started with roughly 100 nodes, and end up with around 1600.\r\n\r\nCounter example where the issue doesn\'t happen:\r\n\r\n1) Modify the `if` statement in `helloworld.js` inside the \'persistentFocus\' directive, so that the directive code doesn\'t run. Run the above 4 steps and see that we start with roughly 100 nodes, and finish with roughly 100 nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am able to reproduce this on \r\n\r\nLinux Chrome Version 55.0.2883.87 (64-bit) \r\nand \r\nOS X Chrome Version 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit)\r\n\r\n\r\n'
