b'Infinite $digest() loop AngularJS with filter expression on html attribute'
b'**I\'m submitting a ...**\r\n- [x] bug report\r\n- [ ] feature request\r\n- [x] other (Please do not submit support requests here (see above))\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\n<!-- Describe how the bug manifests / how the current features are insufficient. -->\r\nWhen I create a filter expression on an html attribute, an attribute that is later bounded incoming in a component and used inside an `ng-repeat`, it triggers an infinite digest cycle/loop. The output comes up fine on the screen, but there are errors in the console suggesting that it triggers and infinite digest cycle. Code to reproduce is on a plnkr: http://plnkr.co/edit/JdiLEIyji2pHd3eeNMUL?p=preview.\r\nThis also happens when the array I\'m passing is an array of literals such as number or string (http://plnkr.co/edit/mfjPgZjBro39Nb7WYpjU?p=preview).\r\n\r\n**Expected / new behavior:**\r\n<!-- Describe what the behavior would be without the bug / how the feature would improve AngularJS -->\r\n1. If it is a bug, then the behaviour without the bug would not result in an infinite digest cycle, and it would improve readability / seperation of concerns. As the component I\'m passing in the filtered array only needs to take care of how it\'s showing the items in the array, not extra filter params.\r\n2. If it isn\'t a bug, then I feel documentation needs to be changed as now I feel the error message is unclear to me, and the docs now ways it is possible to use filter expressions inside those places..\r\n\r\n**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions:**\r\n<!--\r\nIf the current behavior is a bug or you can illustrate your feature request better with an example,\r\nplease provide the *STEPS TO REPRODUCE* and if possible a *MINIMAL DEMO* of the problem via\r\nhttps://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:yBpEi4).\r\n-->\r\nHere\'s a plnkr with the code in action http://plnkr.co/edit/JdiLEIyji2pHd3eeNMUL?p=preview - open the devtools in your browser to see the errors appear.\r\n\r\n<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8K8smvXUAAABcc.jpg:large"/>\r\n\r\n**Angular version:** 1.5.* and 1.6.1/2/3\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent stable or in the snapshot AngularJS version (https://code.angularjs.org/snapshot/) -->\r\n\r\n**Browser:** [all]\r\n<!-- All browsers where this could be reproduced (and Operating System if relevant) -->\r\n\r\n**Anything else:**\r\n<!-- e.g. stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix -->\r\n\r\n**Error message**\r\n```\r\nError: [$rootScope:infdig] http://errors.angularjs.org/1.6.3/$rootScope/infdig?p0=10&p1=%5B%5B%7B%22ms\xe2\x80\xa6e%2C%22type%22%3A1%2C%22%24%24hashKey%22%3A%22object%3A5%22%7D%5D%7D%5D%5D\r\n    at eval (angular.js:38)\r\n    at m.$digest (angular.js:18048)\r\n    at m.$apply (angular.js:18280)\r\n    at eval (angular.js:1912)\r\n    at Object.invoke (angular.js:5003)\r\n    at c (angular.js:1910)\r\n    at Object.Pc [as bootstrap] (angular.js:1930)\r\n    at execute (VM877 main.ts!transpiled:21)\r\n    at f (system.js:5)\r\n    at Object.execute (system.js:5)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Possible solutions**\r\n\r\n1. In the repo where I had the problem at first: I did `<todo-list todo-items="$ctrl.todoItems" filter-by="{completed:true}"></todo-list>`. For full source see here: https://github.com/aredfox/todo-angularjs-typescript/commit/e71900b96173b63ebcebb8e6c1fba00fe3997971. **But I feel it\'s working around the problem**, *plus I don\'t understand why this triggers a $digest() cycle and why it shouldn\'t just work*.\r\n\r\n**Related issue**\r\n\r\n1.
