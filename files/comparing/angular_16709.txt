b'fix(ngStyle): skip setting empty value when new style has the property'
b"<!-- General PR submission guidelines https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-pr -->\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce? (Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)**\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior? (You can also link to an open issue here)**\r\nUsing ng-style with CSS transition with jQuery 3.3.1 (currently the latest tag), the animation is disabled in certain circumstances.\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/qz5a46yc/1/\r\n\r\nWithout jQuery (using jqLite.css) or using jQuery 3.2.1, the div animates. I reported to the jQuery dev on this behavior difference: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4185. I think this is a bug in jQuery.\r\n\r\nThis pull request suggests a workaround on the disabled animation issue. I'm not sure how the report to the jQuery will be handled, but we can fix the behavior with reasonable changes in AngularJS. Skipping the common properties with newStyles will fix the animation issue with jQuery 3.3.1, which can be confirmed by https://jsfiddle.net/g3st70fh/1/. I think the diff is reasonable and also improves the performance because the properties in oldStyles and newStyles are same in most cases.\r\n\r\n**What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**\r\nI believe there's no changes except for fixing the animation issue.\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nNo, I believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our [guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits)\r\n- [x] Fix/Feature: [Docs](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#documentation) have been added/updated\r\n- [x] Fix/Feature: Tests have been added; existing tests pass\r\n\r\n**Other information**:\r\n\r\n"
