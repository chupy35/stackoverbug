b'Using ngAnimate can cause serious layout thrashing. Compare two videos:\r\n1) Our current app, `ngAnimate` included: http://youtu.be/kUf9vDYIlt0\r\n2) Our current app with just one difference - removing `ngAnimate` from the list of modules our app depends on: http://youtu.be/210VHxidY0o\r\n\r\nI recorded Timeline profiles for an operation of switching the tab from the second to the third one; version with `ngAnimate` causes a massive amount of reflows:\r\n1) Timeline with `ngAnimate` included:\r\n![with-ng-animate](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1758366/1193892/da10e8e8-247b-11e3-8ffa-aedd54bcde94.png)\r\n2) Timeline without `ngAnimate`:\r\n![without-ng-animate](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1758366/1193897/e7ddda1c-247b-11e3-8060-05256d3e0a86.png)\r\n\r\nOne of my colleagues, @jrencz, created videos of analogous operations on his 4-year-old MacBook, notice the slowness:\r\n1) `ngAnimate` included: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEmSiWq1qAI\r\n2) `ngAnimate` excluded: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bshDaxUAzU4\r\n'
