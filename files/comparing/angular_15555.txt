b'fix($compile): support transcluding multi-element directives'
b'**What kind of change does this PR introduce? (Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)**\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior? (You can also link to an open issue here)**\r\nTranscluding multi-element directives (e.g. `foo-start`/`foo-end`) is not supported on elements with multi-slot transclusion (a `uterdir` error is thrown).\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**\r\nTranscluded nodes are put into a DocumentFragment, where they can be traversed via `.nextSibling`. This way, transcluding multi-element directives on elements with multi-slot transclusion works correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] ~~Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)~~\r\n\r\n**Other information**:\r\nFixes #15554.'
