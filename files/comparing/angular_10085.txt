b'fix(minErr/ngRepeat/$rootScope): serialization of error objects'
b"This is my preferred solution to #9838.\n`toJson` should throw errors on cyclic object references. JSON is not really designed to handle this out of the box and we should not be hiding the error from the developer.\nAdding a hidden parameter is just making this method convoluted and slowing it down.\n\nInstead we should consider that for error messages, we do not high fidelity serialization of objects but instead a readable string that is useful for debugging. Returning `undefined` for broken JSON stringification is not helpful.\n\nThis fix provides a new function `stringify` which is available within the `angular.js` file and also within the `angular-loader.js` file. This function is then used inside `minErr` and `$rootScope` to provide nice string forms of objects.\n\nPlaces that were using `toJson` to create error messages (i.e. `ngRepeat` and `$rootScope`) no either pass the object directly to `minErr` or they use the `stringify` method directly.\n\nThis solution ensures that we don't confuse the point of `toJson` - it is not a generic stringification tool, it is designed for converting to and from valid JSON. The new method `stringify` also provides us with a single future improvement point if we wished to make the stringification of objects to strings more comprehensive.\n"
