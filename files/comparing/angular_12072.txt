b'fix(orderBy): ensure correct ordering with arrays of objects and no predicate'
b'This fix also considerably refactors how the `orderBy` filter works in internally.\n\nThe new algorithm precomputes the predicate values for the array being ordered. This makes the algorith easier to follow but also ensures that this computation is done a maximum of n times, whereas in the previous algorithm it could be greater. The downside is that we must temporarily store this intermediate array.\n\nThere could be performance implications, but they are as likely to be beneficial as detrimental. It could probably do with benchmarking.\n\nCloses #11866\n'
