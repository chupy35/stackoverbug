b'fix(select): do not break when removing the element (e.g. via `ngIf`)'
b'**What kind of change does this PR introduce? (Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)**\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior? (You can also link to an open issue here)**\r\nWhen removing `<option>` elements, we schedule some operations on the `ngModelCtrl`. For performance reasons, these operation are scheduled to be run as a post-digest operation. If the `<select>` element happens to be removed as well (and its scope destroyed), an error may be thrown due to certain values not being available on the `$scope`.\r\nSee #15466.\r\n\r\n**What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**\r\nNothing breaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] ~~Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)~~\r\n\r\n**Other information**:\r\nFixes #15466.'
