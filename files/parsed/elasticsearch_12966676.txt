12966676 how multi tenancy is supported in elastic search?

I am just wondering how multi-tenancy is supported in ElasticSearch? Multi-
tenancy means that different customers can have different index. Would
ElasticSearch builds different index per customer or a single index (a kind of
sparse index)?

Basically you are correct. Multi-tenancy in ElasticSearch means:

  * Configure indices assigned to specific user accounts
  * Configure aliases with specific filtering/routing that can be assigned to specific user accounts

Hope that helps...
