15929573 How to stop a ongoing import in elasticsearch

I have setup a jdbc river wiht oneshot strategy and successfuly imported my DB
data.

But when I restart the server it's begin to reindex all data again.

How can I stop this process ?

When river is done, you can just delete it from the _river index using this
command:

    
    
    curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_river/you_river_name
    

You can close the river and then re-open at a later point of time:

    
    
    POST _river/_close
    

To open:

    
    
    POST _river/_open
    

Note: I have executed these from sense where my cluster ip is : localhost:9200

**Update**

DELETE _river will do.
