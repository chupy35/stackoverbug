17970028 How to see the value of the _all field

I am using Elasticsearch. Do we have any way to view the value of `_all`
field, like other fields viewed in `_source`?

Based on javanna's answer here
(<https://stackoverflow.com/a/16526383/382774>), the answer is no, you can't
view the _all field. It is an indexed field, not a stored field.

Simplified, it's just the aggregated contents of the applicable fields from
your document, and is the default field that ES uses for searching, when a
target field isn't specified in your queries.

Actually you can, but you'd have to peek into the index directly to see what
is stored there, using an index analyzer tool such as luke:

Hope this helps ;)
