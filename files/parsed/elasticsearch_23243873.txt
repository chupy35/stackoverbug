23243873 Automatically add analyzer to property when indexing

So I followed
[this](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/ngrams-
compound-words.html) tutorial on how to set up Partial Word Searching using
ngrams for compound words. In the mapping when creating the index they
specify:

    
    
    "mappings": {
            "my_type": {
                "properties": {
                    "text": {
                        "type":     "string",
                        "analyzer": "trigrams" 
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    

So how would I allow elasticsearch to add that `"analyzer": "trigram"`
property to a new field when I index a document. Lets say I have a new
property called `homeNumber` how would I set it too.

    
    
    "homeNumber": {
              "type": "string",
              "analyzer": "trigrams" 
     }
    

Using the [Mapping
API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
put-mapping.html), eg. in the first sense example under "mapping" on the
[page](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/ngrams-
compound-words.html) you linked.
