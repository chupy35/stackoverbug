20208927 Elastic index/search_analyzer match all tokens

In my mapping file for ElasticSearch, for `"all"`, I have `index_analyzer` and
`search_analyzer`:

    
    
    {
      "all": {
        "enabled" : true,
        "index_analyzer" : "index_analyzer",
        "search_analyzer" : "search_analyzer"
      }
    }
    

If I search `"foo bar"` on `all`, it returns hits for `foo` `OR` `bar`. How
would I make this `AND` by default?

From the documentation of [Match
Query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-match-query.html)

The default match query is of type boolean. It means that the text provided is
analyzed and the analysis process constructs a boolean query from the provided
text. The operator flag can be set to or or and to control the boolean clauses
(defaults to or). The minimum number of should clauses to match can be set
using the minimum_should_match parameter.

Here is an example when providing additional parameters (note the slight
change in structure, message is the field name):

    
    
    {
        "match" : {
            "message" : {
                "query" : "this is a test",
                "operator" : "and"
            }
        }
    }
