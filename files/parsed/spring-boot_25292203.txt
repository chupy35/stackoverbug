25292203 Do spring boot profiles play nicely with env variables?

I know it's possible to set the "profile" for springboot by using a switch at
the command line (great for tests) but is it possible to set this "profile"
using a system env variable also/ instead?

I'm doing deployments and I'd prefer to have a env var on the box that states
what profile spring boot should be using / etc

thank you in advance!

You can use the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable to specify
specific profiles or `SPRING_PROFILES_DEFAULT` to specify the default profile
to use if none are active.
