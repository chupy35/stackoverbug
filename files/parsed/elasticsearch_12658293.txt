12658293 elasticsearch query string analyzer for different fields with
different analyzers

When performing a query on multiple fields which have different analyzers
(stem, ngram, etc..), does elasticsearch perform specific analyzing on the
query string for each field?

Yes it does, unless you specify an analyzer within your query. The
[query_string](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/query-
string-query.html) query gets translated to a bool or a dismax query depending
on the `use_dis_max` parameter within your query. A different query will be
generated for each field, and the `search_analyzer` related to each specific
field will be used to analyze the query.
