23639991 Elasticsearch Boosting Search Terms

I have an elasticsearch index that I am trying to search for matches based on
multiple fields (title and description). If a particular term shows up in the
title I want to be able to boost the score by 2*original score. If it is in
description it should remain the original score. I am a bit confused by the
elasticsearch documentation. Can anyone help me adjust the following query to
reflect this logic?

    
    
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": {
                "query": "string",
                "fields": ["title","description"]
             }
         }
    }
    

You just need to add `^2` to get a boost on the field you want:

    
    
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": {
                "query": "string",
                "fields": ["title^2","description"]
             }
         }
    }
