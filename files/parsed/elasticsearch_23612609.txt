23612609 How to use copy_to on a nested field

Is it possible to use copy_to in a nested field :

Here is an extract of my mapping :

    
    
    day: {
        type: nested
        properties: {
            weight: {
                index_name: bzixtz2fng.day.weight
                type: double
            }
            value: {
                index_name: bzixtz2fng.day.value
                type: string
                copy_to: [
                    raw_words
                    back
                ]
            }
        } 
    }
    

Why I don't find my doc when I search on back

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "term": {
          "back": "one"
        }
      }
    }
    

PS : Version 1.0.1

I think you need to use the nested query or filter to wrap your term query as
explained here:
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-nested-query.html>.

Something like this should work:

    
    
    {
        "nested": {
            "path": "obj1",
            "score_mode": "avg",
            "query": {
                "nested": {
                    "term": {
                        "obj1.back": "one"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

If that doesn't help, please provide the mapping returned from /_mapping.

It was an issue [#6701](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6701)
on elasticsearch, fix in v1.4.0.
