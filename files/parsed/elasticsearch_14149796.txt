14149796 Is there any way in elasticsearch to get a part of searching result?

I want to know if there is some way to get a part of result in elasticsearch?
For exmaple, there are 100 searching results and want to get 20 results from
50 to 70.

You can use `from` and `size` fields on
[URI](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/uri-
request.html) or in the search
[request](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/from-
size.html).
