20742944 Elastic Search - Having clause equivalent

I have written a faceted query which returns the faceted results (equivalent
to Group by in the SQL World).

Now, I would like to get only the faceted results where the count is greater
than a particular number (Equivalent to Having clause in SQL)

Any suggestions on the same?

Update : added the query.

I need only the locations where the count is greater than 5. For e.g. US has
7, UK has 5 , and rest has 3 each. So want to return US and UK only in the
result.

    
    
    "facets": 
    {
       "locations":
       {
            "terms": 
            {
            "field": "location"
            },      
            "facet_filter":
            {         
                "terms": { "location": [ "US", "UK", "DE", "FR", "JP"  ]} 
            }
       }
    }
    

`HAVING` clauses are not implemented in Elasticsearch yet. You have to handle
that client-side.

See <https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8110>

There are plans to add it, but it has not been done as of May 2015.
