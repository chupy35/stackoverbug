24064623 Elastic Search facet counts don't add up to total hits

Please see my gist for the full details:
<https://gist.github.com/jenkoian/85a3f69fcbf88a87538e>

Most of the searching I've done on this has brought me back to
<https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/1305> so I tried
putting my index on a single shard and I get the same issue with incorrect
counts.

Did you specify `search_type=dfs_query_then_fetch` ?
