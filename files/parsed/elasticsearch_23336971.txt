23336971 search for a certain text between within a range of a certain
timestamp with Elasticsearch

I have worked with Elasticsearch and have done some research on the Internet
how to query data with a certain text and how to query data within a range of
timestamp, using Elasticsearch PHP Client API. Now I would like to combine
these two queries in one. Lets say search for a certain text and within a
range of a certain timestamp. Can someone please tell me how to do that using
Elasticsearch PHP Client API? Thanks in advanced! I have searched on the
Internet but still cannot combine these two queries in one :-(

Here is an example of a bool query, the logic here is that the record must
fall within a date range and should also contain the text in the `textfield`
field. **You could have both query conditions within the must clause.**

    
    
    {
        "from": 0,
        "size": 20,
        "query": {
            "bool": {
                "must": [
                    {
                        "range": {
                            "datefield": {
                                "gte": "from",
                                "lte": "to"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "should": [
                    {
                        "match": {
                            "textfield": {
                                "query": "Name",
                                "boost": 10
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    

**UPDATE - OR MUST HAVE BOTH**

    
    
    {
        "from": 0,
        "size": 20,
        "query": {
            "bool": {
                "must": [
                    {
                        "range": {
                            "datefield": {
                                "gte": "from",
                                "lte": "to"
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "match": {
                            "textfield": {
                                "query": "Name",
                                "boost": 10
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
