23700384 Could not run simple spring boot application() generated by STS tool

I am new to Java and SPRING, Have latest STS tool and JAVA 1.6, Able to create
and run Spring MVC project.

Started looking in to spring boot, created a spring starter project Selected
'web' and picked everything default

Had multiple error in Application.Java file(See below) Fixed by adding JRE in
build path. Try to run it getting Run time exception (See below).

Question : Why IDE was not able add JRE in build path for spring boot?  Why I
still can't run this application. Am I missing some configuration because of
which IDE is not generating correct project.

Help is appreciated.

Thanks

I followed [this REST-guide](http://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/) with no
error. Can you give more code in Applicaion.Java ?

OR Follow the correct guide ,[spring REST code in
github](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service).The 'init' folder is
a empty maven(/gradle) project. After your coding .your code is like the
'complete' folder .

You need to update the start class in the pom.xml file.

In pom.xml look for the below section and update the correct location of the
start-class with the correct package.

    
    
    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <start-class>com.DemoApplication</start-class>
        <java.version>1.7</java.version>
    </properties>
    

I got same issue, fix by create new spring project, java1.7, group=> com.xxx,
and artifact id=> package
