18571824 Using term query with Or operator

I am trying to use the term query the following way!!

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "term": {
                "technology": "Space"
              }
            },
            {
              "term": {
                "Person": "Steve Simon"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

Which returns me a response of feeds which has both fields present in single
feed like an intersection operation. Can I use the term query to get UNION
result for the above query like, I want all feeds which has `space`, `Steve
Simon` present individually with feeds which has both present.

Use `should` instead of `must`. Also you have to set `minimum_should_match` to
1 which means that only one `should` clause is needed for matching a document.

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "should": [
            {
              "term": {
                "technology": "Space"
              }
            },
            {
              "term": {
                "Person": "Steve Simon"
              }
            }
          ],
          "minimum_should_match": 1
        }
      }
    }
