28383604 How to show the state of a checkbox with used 'linkState' in reactjs?

I want to use `linkState` for a checkbox, but I found I can't get the state
back and show it:

    
    
    var Item = React.createClass({
      mixins: [React.addons.LinkedStateMixin],
      getInitialState: function() {
        return {
          ok: true
        }
      },
      render: function() {
         return (
         <div>
           <input type="checkbox" checkedLink={this.linkState('ok')} />
           Is it OK: [{this.state.ok}]
           </div>
         )
      }
    });
    React.render(<Item />, document.body);
    

The key line is:

    
    
    Is it OK: [{this.state.ok}]
    

But the state is not shown. Is it correct to use `this.state.ok` to show it?

Your main code is correct, the actual problem is with how you're debugging the
code.

  * `<div>{true}</div>` renders as `<div>true</div>`
  * `<div>{false}</div>` renders as `<div></div>`

To just drop state into a component's render I use this snippet:

    
    
    <pre>{JSON.stringify(this.state, null, 4)}</pre>

If you have a boolean and want to render the string representation, do
`String(thatBoolean)`. React will always render your string exactly as you
tell it to, but there are quite a few edge cases for non-string values.
