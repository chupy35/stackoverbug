13997783 ElasticSearch routing field

Are there any guidelines for selecting a field to be used for routing in
ElasticSearch? Previously we've had success using the `user_id` for an index
of about ~750K documents (we have about 10K users).

For a second index, I didn't use the `user_id` field, and instead used a
different ID that was much larger (750K). Performance seems subpar, but its
hard to pin down if the routing field is the cause (it is required), as there
are 30 million documents stored.

(I'll admit I'm thinking the query analyzer works in a similar fashion to a
traditional SQL based one, and this may not be the case.)
