23605548 How to get the correct suggestion for the wrong searched term in
ElasticSearch?

I am quite new to ElasticSearch and it has been very nice getting to know
about it. I have to implement something as the image attached below suggests.
How do I hit this? I tried looking for it but did not get anything close to
it. SO had to post it as a new question.

Does ES have to do anything with it?

Take a look at
[Suggesters](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
suggesters.html)

"The suggest feature suggests similar looking terms based on a provided text
by using a suggester. Parts of the suggest feature are still under
development."

you can use
thisï¼š<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
suggesters.html>

using term suggest,it can fix you wrong word from it's dictionary.
