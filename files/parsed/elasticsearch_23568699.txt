23568699 Odd behavior with AND condition in elasticsearch

When I run the query `(tags:("a"))` in elasticsearch, I get 0 results. My
query URL looks like:

    
    
    http://127.0.0.1:9200/haystack/_search?q=(tags%3A(%22a%22))
    

That is to be expected, since no objects have a tag set to "a".

Now when I change the condition, and add an AND, `(org:("1") AND tags:("a"))`,
**I get 3 results back**! The query URL looks like:

    
    
    http://127.0.0.1:9200/haystack/_search?q=(org%3A(%221%22)%20AND%20tags%3A(%22a%22))
    

Getting _more_ results back does not make any sense to me. I would expect that
kind of behavior with the OR operator, but AND? What is going on?
