22010367 how to modify stop word list in elastic search?

I am quite new to elastic search, we are trying to incorporate new search
engine(Elastic search) in our project. But we have specific stop words list
maintained for project.

Is there any stop words file is maintained in elastic search ? Where it is
located ?

Take a look at this [Stop Words
Analyzer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
stop-analyzer.html) and [Stop Words
Filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
stop-tokenfilter.html). These docs define how you would use your own stopwords
in ES. Hope it helps

you can write your custom analyzer for specific stop words if you want to
introduce or you can use in-build analyzer which meets your requirement.
please refer below link to add stop words manually in custom analyzer.

    {
      "settings": {
        "analysis": {
          "analyzer": {
            "custom_analyzer": { 
              "type": "standard", 
              "stopwords": [ "and", "the" ] 
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
