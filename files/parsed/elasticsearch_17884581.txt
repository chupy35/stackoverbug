17884581 elasticsearch - how to copy data to another cluster

How can I get an elasticsearch index to a file and then insert that data to
another cluster? I want to move data from one cluster to another but I can't
connect them directly.

There is script which will help you to backup and restore indices from one
cluster to another. i didn't tested this but may be it will fix your needs.
check this [Backup and restore an Elastic search
index](https://github.com/clintongormley/ElasticSearch.pm)

And you can also use perl script to copy index from one cluster to another (or
the same cluster).

check this link
[clintongormley/ElasticSearch.pm](https://github.com/clintongormley/ElasticSearch.pm)

If you no need to keep _id the same and only important bit is _source you may
use logstash with config:

    
    
    input { //from one cluster } output { //to another cluster }
    

here is more info: <http://www.logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/>

Yes it's method is weird, but I tried it for instant data transfer between
clusters index by index and it is working as a charm (of course if you no need
to keep _id generated by elasticsearch)
