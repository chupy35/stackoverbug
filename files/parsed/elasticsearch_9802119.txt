9802119 Performance based on length of "terms"

I have following criteria in the query. The terms list for seen by can grow
significantly large. There are also a couple of similar kind of list in
"must_not" clause and those can be grow large too.

    
    
              {
                "terms": {
                  "seen_by": [
                    "54",
                    "3",
                    "418",
                    "411",
                    "1",
                    "101"
                  ]
                }
              }
    

What will be the performance difference if the list of terms in conditions
grows or shrinks?

It's difficult to answer this question without knowing details about your data
size, terms distribution and queries. In general, the number of terms is
contributing linearly into search time. Basically, the search engine has to
pull a list of documents for every term in your query. Because of this, it's
typically not recommended to execute queries with very large number of terms
and elasticsearch is actually limiting the number of clauses in boolean
queries to 1024 (it can be changed using indices.query.bool.max_clause_count
setting).
