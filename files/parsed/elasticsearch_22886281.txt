22886281 Expand date ranges for aggregations on ElasticSearch

I have create a dimension with a series of values and From/To fields and
stored it all on elasticsearch.

I now need to create aggregations on some attributes but expanded by day on
the range of dates given. For instance, I have the following:

    
    
    Location       Sales Region  From        To
    
    San Francisco  West          1/1/2013    12/01/2013
    Oakland        West          12/02/2013  04/05/2014
    

But now, I need an aggregate to return

    
    
    Date, Location, Count(*)
    
    1/1/2013, San Francisco, 1
    
    1/2/2013, San Francisco, 2
    
    ...
    
    12/02/2013 Oakland 1
    
    ...
    
    04/05/2014 Oakland 1
    

Can you give me a tip how to blow up my range so this can happen or if elastic
search already offers something similar?
