23085506 Elasticsearch combine two different query types in one request

I'm wondering if there is a possibility to combine two query types, in my case
I need a **match** and **wildcard** query, each has to operate on a different
field.

The thing is, a document matches if the entity name (the document is the
representation of the entity) matches the name with a wildcard at the end of
the search term OR it matches if it is a exact match on one of the synonyms of
the entity. Not both querys have to match, just one of them to consider the
document as relevant.

Currently I need two requests to archive this:

Wildcard:

    
    
    GET /name/type/_search
    {
       "query": {
          "wildcard": {
             "name": {
                "value": "term*",
                "boost": 2
             }
          }
       }
    }
    

Match:

    
    
    GET /name/type/_search
    {
       "query": {
          "match": {
             "synonyms": "term"
          }
       }
    }
    

Is there a way to do it with one request? All my tests failed.

This is the one your are looking for..!

    
    
    curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/try/_search" -d'
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "should": [
            {
              "wildcard": {
                "name": {
                  "value": "term*",
                  "boost": 2
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "match": {
                "synonyms": "term"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }'
