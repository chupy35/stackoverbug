24351121 can @ConfigurationProperties annotated class auto refresh?

Can `@ConfigurationProperties annotated class` be auto refreshed when a value
is changed in `application.properties` ?

Or do we have to restart to make the new value apply?

Short answer: "no". There is no general way to know if a change in
application.properties requires a restart (e.g. a TCP port change) or not. If
you know that a change will not require a restart then you can rebind the
configuration properties using the `PropertiesConfigurationFactory` (or the
public API of `ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor`).
