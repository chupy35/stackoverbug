19666307 ElasticSearch Performance : Continuous read/write vs Bulk write

I am new to Elastic Search. I need to implement a system where I will be
getting data feed continuously throughout the day. I would like to make this
data feed searchable so I am using ElasticSearch.

Now, I have two ways to go about this: 1) Store data from the feed in mongo.
And feed this data to ElasticSearch at regular interval, let say twice a day.
2) Directly feed data to ElasticSearch which is s continuous process. At the
same time ElasticSearch has to perform search queries.

I am expecting a volume of around 20 entries per second coming from data feed
and around 2-3 queries per second being performed by ElasticSearch.

Please advice.

Can you tell us more about your cluster architecture? How many nodes? All
nodes have data or also gateway nodes? Usually I would say feeding directly to
elasticsearch shouldn't be a problem. 2-3 queries per second is not much at
all for elasticsearch.

You should optimize your index structure and application code for it:

  1. Create separate index for each day 
  2. Increase number of shards (you should experiment, based on your hardware configuration) 
  3. For old days indexes you should close them or aggregate into big periods (another month indexes) using some batch processing

from my tests 20 inserts/second is not a big load for elasticsearch
