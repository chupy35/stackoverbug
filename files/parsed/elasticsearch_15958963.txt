15958963 What is the behaviour of arcDistance script field filter with a multi
valued field geo_point?

What is the behaviour of the script filter:

    
    
    doc['distance'] >= doc['locations'].arcDistance(lat, lon)
    

If locations is a multi valued field of type geo_point?

I would like for it to match if any of the locations meet the criteria. From
experimentation I think it matches the first point.

When you return the distance:

    
    
    doc['locations'].arcDistance(lat, lon)
    

Which point will it pick? The first?

I managed to look this up in the source code. It only uses the first location.
