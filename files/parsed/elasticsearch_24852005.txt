24852005 Elasticsearch: how can I filter on a boolean field

I am new to Elasticsearch. I have a mapping which has a boolean field.

I need to filter on this field, and I am not sure which filter to use. Based
on my research, I probably should use term filter. Is this correct? To me, the
term filter seems to be designed for string fields.

Thanks!

Yes, a term filter is the correct choice:
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-term-filter.html>

Think of the boolean field as containing either the term T or the term F, so a
term filter is appropriate.

See these two discussions: <http://elasticsearch-
