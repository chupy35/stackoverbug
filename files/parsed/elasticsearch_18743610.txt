18743610 Exact match on some fields and "fuzzy" search on others?

I am attempting to create a query to exactly match on a few fields, such as
`account_id` and `from_addresses` (which is an array), while also fuzzy
matching on another field such as `message_content`. What is the best way to
do this?

I have tried a Bool query with a few `must` and `should` parameters but can't
seem to get it working.

I believe what you want to do it to use Filters. More specifically, an AND
filter. So your query `message_content`, but filter by `account_id` and
`from_addresses`.

I don't know which library you are using, so I can't really provide any code
examples.
