31615159 Spring Boot Tutorial doesn't work with multi project gradle setup

i get a strange behaviour (at least for me :D) when I switch from the gradle
file located in <https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/> to a multi
project gradle file setup.

build.gradle in root directory

    
    
    //Applied to all projects.
    allprojects {
        apply plugin: 'eclipse'
        apply plugin: 'idea'
    
    
        group = 'de.test.platform'
        version = '0.1'
    }
    
    subprojects {
    
        //Currently all subprojects are also java projects. If this changes we
        //need to move it into the corresponding projects
        apply plugin: 'java'
    
        sourceCompatibility = 1.8
        targetCompatibility = 1.8
    
        repositories {
            mavenLocal()
            mavenCentral()
        }
    
        idea {
            module {
                downloadSources = true
                downloadJavadoc = false
            }
        }
    }
    
    idea {
        project {
            jdkName = '1.8'
            languageLevel = '1.8'
        }
    }
    

build.gradle in sub directory frontend (thus sub project called :frontend)

    
    
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenCentral()
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.2.5.RELEASE")
        }
    }
    
    apply plugin: 'war'
    apply plugin: 'spring-boot'
    
    jar {
        baseName = 'crowdio-frontend'
        version = '0.1.0'
    }
    
    dependencies {
        compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
        testCompile("junit:junit")
    }
    

when I run gradle bootRun and navigate to <http://localhost:8080/greeting> as
in the tutorial i get a infinite loop error. If i change the template from
greeting.html to hello.html and return hello instead of greeting in the
controller greeting() action i get an 404 Error.

The template is stored in
project_root/frontend/src/main/resources/templates/greeting.html

It seems like that for whatever Reason spring boot can decide on thymeleaf
with the exact structure of the gradle build file like in the tutorial.
However if you switch to a multi project setup you need to add

    
    
    compile("org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf-spring4")
    

as a dependency.
