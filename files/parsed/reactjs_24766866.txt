24766866 ReactJs: Set data- attributes on elements without JSX

React supports data-* and aria-* attributes on elements. When using the
component API, I would guess these attributes could be set just like the rest:

    
    
    React.DOM.div({style: {...}, dataMyFoo: 'bar'}, ...)
    

Nope. That doesn't work. The `dataMyFoo` attribute is silently ignored. I read
somewhere that these need to be all lowercase. How about:

    
    
    React.DOM.div({style: {...}, datamyfoo: 'bar'}, ...)
    

Again, silently ignored.

Is this possible? If so, what is the secret? I spent quite a while searching
without finding the answer.

The answer, it turns out, is to use hyphen-separated all lowercase names for
the data attribute, like so:

    
    
    React.DOM.div({style: {...}, 'data-my-foo': 'bar'}, ...)
    

Note that you must quote the attribute name in this case, since hyphens are
not allowed in identifiers in Javascript.
