16546294 How to delete document types in elasticsearch?

I create an index "myindex" with a specified document type "mytype". I am able
to delete the index, but it appears that "mytype" still exists without being
tied to the index.

How do I get rid of "mytype"?

If you really deleted the index, the mapping in this index should not exist
anymore. Do you have any other index in your cluster with a similar type name?

To answer to the question: `How to delete document types in elasticsearch?`,
use [Delete Mapping
API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-indices-delete-
mapping/):

    
    
    curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/index/type
    

**EDIT** : From elasticsearch 2.0, it won't be possible anymore. See [Mapping
changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/2.0/plugins-
delete-by-query.html). You will have to install the [Delete By Query
plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/plugins-
delete-by-query.html) and run a query which will remove your documents but the
mapping will still exist. So it will most likely better to reindex your
documents in another index without the old type.

But as @mguillemin and @javanna said, when you delete an index, every mapping
attached to this index is deleted as well:

    
    
    curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/index
    

In the latest version of elastic search, they no longer support deleting
document types. It's mentioned in the
[documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
delete-mapping.html)

> It is no longer possible to delete the mapping for a type. Instead you
should delete the index and recreate it with the new mappings.

You can use `_delete_by_query` path to delete type.

    
    
    POST index-name/type-name/_delete_by_query
    {
        "query": { 
            "match": {
                "message": "some message"
            }
        }
    }
    

You don't even need to specify the request body. Just

    
    
    curl -XPOST http://<host>:9200/<index>/<type>/_delete_by_query
