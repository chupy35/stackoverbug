24016375 To get all rows from ElasticSearch query

I have searched for answer to this several times and have found same question
here also. But none really answers the question. I know how to use size
parameter in ES queries. But If I don't know the size and I want to get ALL
records of ES query (not just default 10 or even 50 000 records (with size),
etc). Desperately I have also tried to use size=* and size=0, if that could
pass the limit and return unlimited amount of rows.

Pagination (that ES suggests) also doesn't help, because that is not suitable
for the job.

You need the [count
api](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
count.html). Do your query against the count api, get the number of results,
then set this number as your limit for the query, then run this against the
normal search api to get all of your results.
