15419802 Extract properties from indexed data in elasticsearch

I have trouble understanding the possibilities of tokenizers and analyzers in
Elasticsearch.

Suppose there is a set of indexed data of products. Each product has a field
with a description text. In the description a color is named.

Is it possible to use one of the built in analyzers or a custom
tokenizer/analyzer to extract that color information (eg. based on a set of
keywords [red,green,blue,yellow etc.]) and attach that new color information
as a separate field to the product?

Would be a nice feature to augment incoming data with generic properties (eg.
colors, material etc.)

The process you describe has more to do with entity recognition. There are
different libraries that do that give a text:
[OpenNLP](http://opennlp.apache.org/), [UIMA](http://uima.apache.org/) and
more.

You might want to have a look at the [elasticsearch OpenNLP
plugin](https://github.com/spinscale/elasticsearch-opennlp-plugin), which does
exactly what you want: detects entities and adds corresponding fields to the
incoming documents.
