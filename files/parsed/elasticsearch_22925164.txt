22925164 elasticsearch restart leave unassigned shards

I have to restart elasticsearch cluster nodes because of some timeout
exceptions  I did restart the nodes one by one there are 5 data nodes in
cluster  But when I did that it leave some shards unassigned and I have no
replicas There is nothing help full in logs. Can I get some help to know why
these shards remain unassigned and any solution Thanks

Run this against your cluster, should rerun the command once shards have
relocated however change the false parameter to `true` \-

    
    
    curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_settings' -d ' {"index.routing.allocation.disable_allocation": false}'
    

yeah, you will find some shards as unassigned. Give them some time to get
allocated after the cluster gets restarted
