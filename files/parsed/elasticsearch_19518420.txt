19518420 Are there any tools or best practices for documenting an
ElasticSearch db

I'm looking for documentation about documenting an ElasticSearch deployment
(you can see why this is challenging to Google!).

My question is really two questions. Are there best practices for documenting
an ElasticSearch installation? -and- Are there any tools that aid in the
visualization of an ElasticSearch installation. I guess it would be akin to a
sql db schema (ER diagram or whatever). I've scoured Google without much luck
and I didn't find anything on SO.

Documenting ES may be a bit more challenging than documenting a sql db since
you probably want to be able to show the relationship between end user queries
and indexing to explain the context of each mapping. Furthermore, it would be
useful to visualize the cluster (perhaps a separate problem that could be
solved with existing tools).

Thanks for any help.
