28368266 Spring Boot:: Not able to override context path from application.yml

I am just trying to set my context path as /v1/audit-management instead of my
application war name(Audit_Management_DS-1.0-SNAPSHOT) but it's not working.
My entry in application.yml (location of this is src/main/resources) is as
follows

server: context-path: /v1/audit-management

When I hit the URL <http://localhost:1234/v1/audit-management> its giving HTTP
404. However <http://localhost:1234/Audit_Management_DS-1.0-SNAPSHOT> is
working fine.

When you deploy your application as a war file to an external servlet
container Spring Boot's server isn't being used so configuring its context
path has no effect. If you want to configure the context path you'll need to
rename your war file or use one of the other mechanisms supported by Tomcat
such as using a context.xml file in your war.
