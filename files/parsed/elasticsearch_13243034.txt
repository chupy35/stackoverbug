13243034 Is there a way to remove/ignore matches that have a low score in
elasticsearch?

I am getting results that have scores of over 40 for a search but I am also
getting way more items with scores under 5. Is there a way to set a bottom
threshold so I am not displaying these low-score results but only the high
scoring ones? Or is there a better way of doing this? Thank you!

Have a look at
[min_score](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/min-
score.html) option in Search API.

Hope this helps.
