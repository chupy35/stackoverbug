12646238 Pitfalls of using memory storage of index with local gateway

I read <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/store.html>
and want to change my settings to load indexes into memory vs disk but on that
page it says

"When using a local gateway (the default), file system storage with no in
memory storage is required to maintain index consistency. This is required
since the local gateway constructs its state from the local index state of
each node."

We only have one node running right now, so I'm wondering if I can still do it
to get a performance improvement. Just wanted to see if there are some real
ramifications to doing this that I'm not considering.

If you will create an index with memory store and local gateway this index
will disappear after the next cluster restart. I think what you are looking
for is [file system store with memory
caching](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/82).
