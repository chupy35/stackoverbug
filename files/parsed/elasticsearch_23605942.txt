23605942 ElasticSearch MapperParsingException object mapping

I folow a article about ElasticSearch and I try put this example on my engine.

example:

    
    
    curl -XPUT 'elasticsearch:9200/twitter/tweet/1' -d '{
        "user": "david",
        "message": "C'est mon premier message de la journ√©e !",
        "postDate": "2010-03-15T15:23:56",
        "priority": 2,
        "rank": 10.2
    }'
    

I try to send this information across a bash file (I use Putty), but I have
this errror:

    
    
    {"error":"MapperParsingException[object mapping for [tweet] tried to parse as object, 
      but got EOF, has a concrete value been provided to it?]","status":400}
    

I also try to see one error with "cat -e tweet.sh", but I don't understand why
I've got this error.

Thanks in advance.

It's a type mismatching. I'm facing with such issue too. It looks like you try
to index a value into an object mapped json. i.e., you indexed one time
something like this:

    
    
    {
      "obj1": {
        "field1": "value1"
      }
    }
    

and then index this:

    
    
    {
      "obj1": "value"
    }
    

Check your existing mapping via `elasticsearch:9200/twitter/_mapping` and you
will see if that one of the field was indexed as `object`
