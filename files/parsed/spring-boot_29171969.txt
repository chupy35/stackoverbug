29171969 How can I suppress the default config location of Spring boot

How can I have Spring Boot only look for config files under the the
directories specified by spring.config.location property and _not_ look under
the default location as specified in the ConfigFileApplicationListener
javadoc.

Setting spring.config.location, causes the ConfigFileApplicationListener to
look in both spring.config.location directories and the default locations.

you can use profiles.

in your application.properties you will only have :

    
    
    spring.profiles.active=other
    

and have a file in the same folder named application-other.properties where
you define your properties.

the default properties can be in a file named application-default.properties
and when you want to use it, juste change the value in application.properties
to 'default'.
