25357504 Elasticsearch multi term query rewrite

I'm trying to understand how to use Elasticsearch properly and stumbled at the
concept of [multi term query
rewrite](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-multi-term-rewrite.html).

My question is what does it do exactly? Does it simply affect score
calculation or it changes the whole query being parsed? Or does it do
something else? Any light would be appreciated!

PS: Looking at [this](http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/fuzzy-
matching-and-direct-hit-ranking-td3988602.html) thread sort of suggests me
that it has something to do with fuzzy score calculation.
