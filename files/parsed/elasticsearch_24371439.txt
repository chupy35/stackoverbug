24371439 Elasticsearch: get a list of indexes

Is it possible to get a list of indexes that match a certain pattern e.g

this is how to get a list of indexes:

    
    
    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_stats/'
    

but I couldn't find a way of filter them so that this list would only include
only indexes witch match "my_index_nr_1*" where "*" would be a wild card

### Solution

After using ES for quite a while here is what I use now, hope it will help
someone else:

    
    
    curl -XGET '/_cat/indices/my_index_nr_1*'
    

You can also add `?v` at the end which will give you headers of each column in
result.

This should work :

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/my_index_nr_1*/_stats'
    

There is a neat trick using the _aliases command that when combined with a
wildcard (`my_index_nr_1*` below) will only show you matching index names and
associated indexes:

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/my_index_nr_1*/_aliases?pretty'
    

The result I get is:

    
    
    {
      "my_index_nr_1_test" : {
        "aliases" : { }
      }
    }
    

Very helpful when you have a lot of indexes on a cluster but don't want to see
all the other stats information.

For humans, the best answer is the modified summary:

    
    
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/_cat/indices/my_index_nr_1*?v
    

For machines, the best answer is likely a variation of (`?pretty` is there for
you to see its output):

    
    
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/my_index_nr_1*/_settings?pretty
    

This will get the list of all indices that match, with their settings. The
`_aliases` answer above is just a variation of this request. You can even trim
the request down to:

    
    
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/my_index_nr_1*?pretty
    

However, this will respond with both the settings, aliases, and mappings of
each index.
