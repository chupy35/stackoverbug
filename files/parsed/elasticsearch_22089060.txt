22089060 ElasticSearch fields prefixed with "@"

I see a lot of fields in example mappings that look like `@timestamp`,
`@name`, etc.

What does it mean? Does it make any change or is it some convention? It is
tricky to google and I didn't find any reference reading the doc.

Here's an example: <https://gist.github.com/deverton/2970285>

    
    
            ...
            "properties" : {
                "@fields": { "type": "object", "dynamic": true, "path": "full" }, 
                "@message" : { "type" : "string", "index" : "analyzed" },
                "@source" : { "type" : "string", "index" : "not_analyzed" },
                "@source_host" : { "type" : "string", "index" : "not_analyzed" },
                "@source_path" : { "type" : "string", "index" : "not_analyzed" },
                "@tags": { "type": "string", "index" : "not_analyzed" }, 
                "@timestamp" : { "type" : "date", "index" : "not_analyzed" },
                "@type" : { "type" : "string", "index" : "not_analyzed" }
            }
            ...
    

Those settings do not affect anything. They are standardised logstash fields
which are used so you can easily report on logs originating from multiple
sources.

They are just a logstash convention and not an elasticsearch convention.
