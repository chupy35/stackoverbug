21437612 Setting up a single backup node for an elasticsearch cluster?

Given Elasticsearch cluster with several machines, I would want to have a
single machine(special node) that is located on a different geographical
region that can effectively sync with the cluster for read only purpose. (i.e.
no write for the special node; and that special node should be able to handle
all query on its own). Is it possible and how can this be done?

With elasticsearch 1.0 (currently available in RC1) you can use the [snapshot
& restore
api](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/modules-
snapshots.html); have a look at [this
blog](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/introducing-snapshot-restore/) too to
know more.

You can basically make a snapshot of your indices, then copy the snapshot over
to the secondary location and restore it into a different cluster. The nice
part is that snapshots are incremental, which means that only the files that
have changed since the last snapshot are actually backed up. You can then
create snapshots at regular intervals, and import them into the secondary
cluster.

If you are not using 1.0 yet, I would suggest to have a look at it, snapshot &
restore is a great addition. You can still make backups manually and restore
them with 0.90, but you don't have a nice api to do that and you need to do
everything pretty much manually.
