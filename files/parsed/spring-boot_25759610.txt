25759610 Spring Boot Gradle Tomcat 8 (build.gradle)

I have seen the answer to question [Spring Boot Gradle Tomcat
8](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22621132/spring-boot-gradle-tomcat-8),
but I don't understand where to add the Groovy code. I have put it into
build.gradle, but the application still loads with Tomcat 7.

All you need to is place

    
    
    configurations.all {
      resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details ->
        if (details.requested.group == 'org.apache.tomcat.embed') {
            details.useVersion '8.0.3'
        }
      }
    } 
    

right under the `apply plugin: ***` section in your `build.gradle`.

Check out
[this](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html)
part of the gradle documentation for more details.
