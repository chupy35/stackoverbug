10662959 ElasticSearch all documents returned even when escaped

I have a method that escapes a query using regular expression, wraps the whole
query with asterisk and then send a query to ElasticSearch.

Everything works great except from when a user sends just an asterisk in the
query than I get back all documents. I debugged the code and the query that is
sent to the server is "*\\**", the expected behavior is that all documents
containing an asterisk will be returned but the behavio

What am I missing ?

Thanks
