21666879 Searching synonyms in elasticsearch

I'm trying to create synonym search over languages indexed in ES.

For example,

Indexed document -> name: German

Synonyms: German, Deutsch, XYZ

What I want to make is, when I type either German or Deutsch or XYZ, that ES
returns me German...

Is that possible at all?

Yes very much so. ElasticSearch handles synonyms very well. Here is an example
of how I configured synonyms on my cluster -

    
    
    curl -XPOST localhost:9200/**new-index** -d '{
    "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 2,
    "number_of_replicas": 0,
    "analysis": {
      "filter": {
        "synonym": {
          "type": "synonym",
          "synonyms_path": "synonyms/synonyms.txt"
        }
      },
      "analyzer": {
        "synonym": {
          "tokenizer": "lowercase",
          "filter": [
            "synonym"
          ]
        }
      }
     }
    },
    "mappings": {
    "**new-type**": {
      "_all": {
        "enabled": false
      },
      "properties": {
        "Title": {
          "type": "multi_field",
          "store": "yes",
          "fields": {
            "Title": {
              "type": "string",
              "analyzer": "synonym"
             }
            }
          }
        }
      }
     }
    }'
    

The path for the synonym file looks inside the **config** folder for the
synonym folder and locates the text file. An example of the contents of the
synonyms.txt for your requirements would be -

German, Deutsch, XYZ

**REMEMBER** \- if you have a lower case filter at index time, the synonyms
need to be in lower case. Restart nodes if not working.
