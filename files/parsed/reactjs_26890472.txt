26890472 How to count the number of Grandchildren

New to React and JSX so apologies if this is a very basic question.

I have a "GrandParent" node and I can count the number of "Parent" nodes
using:

    
    
     {React.Children.count(this.props.children)
    

However - given a particular "Parent" - how can I return the count of their
children? I can do it at the parent level, but can't figure out how to do it
at the GrandParent level.

As usual - probably best to explain by example, so I have an example at:
<http://jsfiddle.net/zuoza31g/1/>

I would like my output to be:

    
    
    I am the grandfather 'Grandfather'
    I have '1' children
    I have '4' grandchildren
    
    I am the father 'Father' 
    I have '4' children
    
    I am a son 'Son 1'
    I am a son 'Son 2'
    I am a son 'Son 3'
    I am a son 'Son 4'
    

It's part of a much bigger problem, so I'm simplified it down to this example
..

Can anyone help please?

You can count the number of grand children using following code:

    
    
        var count = 0;
        React.Children.forEach(this.props.children, function (child){
            count = count + React.Children.count(child.props.children);
        });
    

Here is your fiddle with this solution implemented:
