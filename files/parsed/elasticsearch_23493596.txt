23493596 Internal data storage mechanism of elasticsearch

I have been working with elasticsearch for the past 2 months. I have used both
REST approach and API support in different languages to index, get and search
data. I also read a lot about elasticsearch and found out it is not a good
option to use it as a data store. Why is this? And I'm also curious about how
elasticsearch internally stores the indexed data. Any good link or
explanation??

Elastic Search is built on top of Apache Lucene - here's a reference doc on
the Lucene index file structure:

<http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_7_2/core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/lucene46/package-
summary.html#package_description>

Regarding whether or not it's a good option as a data store I think that's
more individual opinion and specific use cases than a fact that can be proved.
It does not have the transaction support that something like MySQL does if
that's what you are looking for. In that case it's somewhat on a par with
other NoSQL solutions. This is a pretty decent writeup on the trade-offs and
issues: <https://www.found.no/foundation/elasticsearch-as-nosql/>

In the end it depends on what you are doing with your data and what level of
robustness you require.
