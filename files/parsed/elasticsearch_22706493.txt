22706493 Do we have any option to perform bulk update in elastic search
without specifying the document id

I need to do bulk update via script in elastic search without specifying the
document id. In 'Books' document type, I have author name. If I rename author
name, I need to bulk update for all 'Books' which are having the updated
author name by using script.

Do I need to get all the book ids having the author name and update all the
books?

    
    
    BulkResponse bulkResponse = client.prepareBulk().add(client.prepareUpdate().setIndex("test").setType("books").setScript(script)).execute().actionGet();
    

By using the above code I am getting the below exception

    
    
    org.elasticsearch.action.ActionRequestValidationException: Validation Failed: 1: id is missing;
    

What you mention is the update by query functionality. It's not available yet,
but since there's a lot of demand for it I guess it will be available one day,
you can have a loot at the related issue on github:
<https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/1607> . The reason why
it wasn't implemented yet is that it is potentially dangerous as it might lead
to a lot of updates and potentially long running queries which cannot be
stopped at this time.
