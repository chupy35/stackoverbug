23128805 Elasticsearch totalHits remains thesame

I am using elasticsearch to search for document from my index. But when ever I
use, .must and .should in the same query, my totalHits stay unchanged. I need
help. the query is below.

    
    
    SearchResponse searchResponse = client.prepareSearch("myindex")
    .setSearchType(SearchType.DFS_QUERY_THEN_FETCH)
    .setQuery(QueryBuilders.boolQuery().must(QueryBuilders.rangeQuery("work_duration")
    .gte(tMin).lte(tMax)).must(QueryBuilders.rangeQuery("DOB").gte(minYear)
    .lte(maxYear)).should(QueryBuilders.termQuery("town",town.toLowerCase().trim()))
    .must(QueryBuilders.termQuery("country",country.toLowerCase().trim()))
    .must(QueryBuilders.matchQuery("content", keyword.toLowerCase().trim())))
    .setFrom(0).setSize(167).execute().actionGet();
    

When mixing must and should, should has no meaning for the total result.
Either you match, what is required (must), or you don't. Documents, that only
match the should clause, cannot be include since they do not match the must
clause. In this case, should is only used to score documents, that also match
these clauses, better.
