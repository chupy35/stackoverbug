23710028 Elastic Search: include multiple field in query

I am new to Elastic Search.I want to include multiple field in my search query
something like:

    
    
          Title=my title and city=mycity or country = mycountry
    

How can I execute this kind of query using java client? I tried this

    
    
    SearchResponse response = client.prepareSearch("titan")
        .setTypes("vertex")
        .setSearchType(SearchType.QUERY_AND_FETCH)
        .setQuery(QueryBuilders.fieldQuery("title", "mytitle"))
        .setQuery(QueryBuilders.fieldQuery("city", "mycity"))
        .setFrom(0).setSize(60).setExplain(true)
        .execute()
        .actionGet();
    

but didn't work

You have to do
[booleanQuery](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-
api/current/query-dsl-queries.html#bool) there, I believe.

Something like:

    
    
    SearchResponse response = client.prepareSearch("titan")
        .setTypes("vertex")
        .setSearchType(SearchType.QUERY_AND_FETCH)
        .setQuery(QueryBuilders.boolQuery()
        .must(QueryBuilders.fieldQuery("title", "mytitle"))
        .should(QueryBuilders.fieldQuery("city", "mycity"))
        .should(QueryBuilders.fieldQuery("country", "mycountry")))
        .setFrom(0).setSize(60).setExplain(true)
        .execute()
        .actionGet();
    

The rules for boolean queries, in a nutshell, are that all `must` clauses are
expected to be true, and at least one from the `should` clauses are expected
to be true (the amount of should clauses which has to be true can be changed,
one is the default).
