14356965 eleastic search 10 hits only

I am using elasticsearch for the first time but when I do a search I am
getting a JSON response from elastic search which gives me the first 10
results. How do I then request the next 10 results and so on?

Ive looked on the API but this dosn't give much insight.

You can use `size` and `from` parameter -
