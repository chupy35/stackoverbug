23470009 Elasticsearch. filtered query with partial_fields possible?

Is it possible to exclude certain field from result ? I'm using filtered query
like this:

    
    
    {
        "size": 10,
        "query": {
            "filtered": {
                "query": {
                    "bool": {
                        "should": [
                            {
                                "text": {
                                    "name": {
                                        "query": "list",
                                        "operator": "or",
                                        "boost": 30
                                    }
                                }
                            },
                            {
                                "text": {
                                    "field2": {
                                        "query": "list",
                                        "operator": "or",
                                        "boost": 0.2
                                    }
                                }
                            },
                            {
                                "text": {
                                    "field1": {
                                        "query": "list",
                                        "operator": "or",
                                        "boost": 0.02
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                },
                "filter": {
                    "and": [
                        {
                            "term": {
                                "_type": "product"
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "filter": {
                "partial_fields": {
                    "exclude": "field3"
                }
            }
        },
        "sort": [
            {
                "_score": "desc"
            }
        ]
    }
    

I've added **filter partial_fields** but it does not seem to have any effect.
I'm using **ES 0.9**

partial_fields can return a partial representation of _source based on include
and exclude patterns

So i guess you should specify a wildcard pattern for field name in exclude. If
your field name is DATA then the exclude pattern should be DAT*..

Keep in mind that partial_fields support has been deprecated as of 1.0.0beta -

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
request-fields.html#partial>

I know you're on 0.9 but at some point you'll need to upgrade and this
approach won't work. I'd suggest upgrading to a 1.x release and using source
filtering instead:
