28333181 Spring boot yml configuration

With Spring Boot, you can specify the following in a `application.yml` to
configure settings for jpa/hibernate:

    
    
    spring:
      jpa:
        hibernate:
          ddlAuto: validate
          namingStrategy: org.hibernate.cfg.EJB3NamingStrategy
        show-sql: false
    

My question: is there a page/doc that lists out all the different configs that
can be defined in the application.yml? (i.e. Where does it say I can configure
jpa/hibernate by the above example?)

There is a section in the official documention:

<http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#common-
application-properties>
