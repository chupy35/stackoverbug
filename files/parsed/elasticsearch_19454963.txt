19454963 index_name and _routing in elasticsearch

I have a mapping as below

    
    
    {
       "obj" : {
          "properties": {
             "name" : {
                  "type" : "string",
                  "index_name" : "firstname"
             }
         },
         "_routing" : {
             "required" : "true",
             "path"  : "name"
    
         }
       }
    }
    

Now if I upload a document like

{ "name" : "test" }

I am getting below error

nested: MapperParsingException[External routing [test] and document path
routing [null] mismatch]

However if I remove "index_name" from the mapping I am able to upload the
document. Am I missing any configuration here ? We would like to retain the
index_name as it provides much more readable string to end user.

I checked the above mapping in 1.3.1 and mapping is getting created.
