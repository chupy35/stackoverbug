23579432 Elastic Search in a complex document

I have a document stated below. I would like to do a search but I could not do
it as I lacked the knowledge. Please help. How can I do searches in
ElasticSearch in complex aggregates?

My Document

    
    
    {
        "_index": "vehicles",
        "_type": "car",
        "_id": "e16bd474-fa8e-4858-ab6c-3bbb3d0aa603",
        "_version": 1,
        "found": true,
        "_source": {
        "Type": {
         "Name": "Mustang"
      }
    }
    

}

My Search Query

    
    
    GET _search 
      {
     "query":{
        "filtered": {
           "filter": {
               "term": {
                  "Name": "Mustang"
               }
                 }
           }
    
         },
     "from":0,
     "size":10
    }
    

If you only want the doc with "Name" : "Mustang" you can use

`"query" : { "bool" : { "must" : { "term" : { "Name" : "Mustang" } } } }`

The [Standard
Analyzer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
standard-analyzer.html) is being applied to your `Name` field, so the term
`Mustang` is being stored in the index as `mustang`. Change your query to use
`"Name": "mustang"` and you should get a match.

There are two issues:

  1. You are using `term` filter which is searching for `Mustang` token in the index, however the standard analyzer is being used so it is actually indexed as `mustang`. 
  2. You are searching in the wrong field. You should be using nested notation e.g. `Type.Name`

This query should work as expected:

`{"query":{ "filtered": { "filter": { "term": { "Type.Name": "mustang" } }}}}`
