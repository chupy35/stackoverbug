22977039 elasticsearch - tips on how to organize my data

I'm trying elasticsearch by getting some data from facebook and twitter to.

The question is: how can I organize this data in index?

    
    
    /objects/posts
    /objects/twits
    

or

    
    
    /posts/post
    /twits/twit
    

I'm trying queries such as, get posts by `author_id = X`

First one is the good approach. Because creating two indices will create two
lucence instances which will effect the response time.

You need to think about the long term when deciding how to structure your data
in Elasticsearch. How much data are you planning on capturing? Are search
requests going to look into both Facebook and Twitter data? Amount of
requests, types of queries and so on.

Personally I would start of with the first approach,
`localhost:9200/social/twitter,facebook/` as this will reduce the need for
another index when it isn't necessarily required. You can search across both
of the types easily which has less overhead than searching across two indexes.
There is quite an interesting article
[here](https://www.found.no/foundation/sizing-elasticsearch/) about how to
grow with intelligence.

Elasticsearch has many configurations, essentially its finding a balance which
fits your data.
