19865756 What is the length and characters in ids generated by elasticsearch?

The
[documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-
index_.html#_automatic_id_generation) of elastic search states:

> The index operation can be executed without specifying the id. In such a
case, an id will be generated automatically.

But it does not provide any information about the properties of the ids.

  * What is the length (minimun/maximum)?    
my guess is `22`.

  * Which characters are used in the id?    
My guess is `[-_A-Za-z0-9]`

  * Can the properties of the generated ids change at any time (is that part of the API)?

Auto-generated ids are random
[base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)-encoded
[UUIDs](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt). The base64 algorithm is used in
[URL-safe mode](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3548.html) hence `-` and `_`
characters might be present in ids.

Auto-generated ids by elasticsearch are exactly 20 characters length (not 22
characters) and encoded by url-safe base64 algorithm [-_A-Za-z0-9].
