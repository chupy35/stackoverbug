28513352 Possible to transfer state/props data from server

Is there a way to transfer state from server to client? I know I can simply
request the initial data again on the client, but that involves extra
requests. Is there a simple way of doing this?

You can transfer initial data from your server as follow:

    
    
    <script>
        var data = <json data serialized by your server language>;
    </script>
    

Then, using `data` variable you can initialize your components' `state` and
`props`.
