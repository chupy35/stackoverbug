11955045 cannot dynamically change page using angular js method

This is the Angular JS function on my page:

    
    
    function DateCtrl($scope) {
    
            $scope.returndate = function () {
    
                return Date.now();
            }
    
        }
    

The markup is as follows:

    
    
    <html ng-app>
    <body>    
    <div id = "date" class = "stats" ng-controller = "DateCtrl">
                <span>Date:</span><div id = "noedate">{{returndate()}}</div>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    

You would expect the date returned in `#nowdate` to change every second thanks
to the data-binding, but it does not. Does anyone know what is wrong here?

I would provide a fiddle but jsfiddle does not support angular yet...

The data won't get updated automatically since AngularJS doesn't constantly
pool for changes but only refreshes templates in response to certain events.
You can check this post: [How does data binding work in
AngularJS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9682092/databinding-in-
angularjs/9693933#9693933) for more info on inner workings of angular.

If you would like to refresh certain value after a given period of time use
the $timeout service (<http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$timeout>).

Actually it is very easy to do a clock in AngularJS using combination of
$watch and $timeout:

    
    
    $scope.time = new Date();  
    $scope.$watch('time', function(){
        $timeout(function(){
            $scope.time = new Date();
        },1000);
    });
    

Here is the complete jsFillde:
<http://jsfiddle.net/pkozlowski_opensource/f5ApP/1/>

    
    
    var updateTime = function () {
        $scope.currentTime = new Date();
        $timeout(updateTime, 1000);
    };
    updateTime();
