24700611 Exclude some documents, wrong query

I'm using this query to get some documents:

    
    
        $rawQuery = array(
            'query' => array(
                'custom_score' => array(
                    'query'  => array(
                        'bool' => array(
                            'must'     => array(
                                "terms"=> ...
                            )                       
                        ),
                    ),
                    'script' => "_score * ...."
                )
            ),
            'from'  => $from,
            'size'  => $size,
        );
    

What I'd like is including something like this:

    
    
    'must_not' => array('terms' => array('is_something' => 'no')),
    

but I don't figure out where I should put this, I tried in the same level of
"must", but it didn't work

In the must_not I changed the "terms" for "term" and worked.
