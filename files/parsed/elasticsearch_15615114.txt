15615114 pyelasticsearch mapping overwritten

I have an index with a mapping of :

    
    
    {
        properties: {
            field1: {
                index: not_analyzed
                omit_norms: true
                index_options: docs
                type: string
            }
           },
           _parent: {
    
           type: parent_doctype
           }
       }
    }
    

All I do is index items (using the "elasticsearch-HEAD" plugin, or a python
client pyelasticsearch) FOr some reason, sometime my mapping seems to get
corrupted - the "_parent" part of the mapping vanishes, and all the parents of
existing documents vanish also.

This is terrible, since I cannot rely on my DB, and item might be corrupted.

I did NOT use any further mapping API calls. What could cause this?

I had some idea that it happens when trying to index with PUT instead of POST
or something like that?

Can _index change the mapping?

It seems I actually erased my own mapping. trying to delete a document i sent:

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/my_index/my_doctype'
    

Then when I indexed another document, the maping was autogenerated, but
withouth the _parent mapping.

awkward....
