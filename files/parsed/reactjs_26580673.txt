26580673 How can I compare this.props.children with nextprops.children

In componentWillReceiveProps I need to compare this.props.children with the
children in nextprops. I can iterate over either structure with
React.Children.forEach but I haven't found any sanctioned mechanism to index
either "opaque" structure.

ComponentWillReceiveProps isn't called after the first render:
<http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/componentWillReceiveProps-not-triggered-
after-mounting.html> You need to do what the other comment says, use
shouldComponentUpdate.

The documentation provides utilities for dealing with the this.props.children
opaque data structure:

<http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.children>

You can index this.props.children either with `React.Children.map` or
`React.Children.forEach`:

>

>     object React.Children.map(object children, function fn [, object
context])

>  
>

> Invoke fn on every immediate child contained within children with this set
to context. If children is a nested object or array it will be traversed: fn
will never be passed the container objects. If children is null or undefined
returns null or undefined rather than an empty object.

>  
>  
>     React.Children.forEach(object children, function fn [, object context])

>

> Like React.Children.map() but does not return an object.
