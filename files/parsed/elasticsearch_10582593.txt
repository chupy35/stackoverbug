10582593 are the numbers stored as strings in elasticsearch?

I am loading my sql data tables into it and wish to get results depending upon
various requirements. I am having a problem in rangequery. When I am writing
this:

    
    
    $ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200/sample/new/_search?pretty=true' -d '
    { query:{range:{price_incl_tax:{gte:1000,lte:1500}}} }'
    

the results where `price_incl_tax=140.0000` as well as `13500.0000` are also
coming.

In your case, `price_incl_tax` seems to be stored as a string. It probably
happend because the `price_incl_tax` field was initially added as a string
instead of a number. You can verify field types in your index by running

`$ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200/sample/new/_mapping?pretty=true'`

Elasticsearch allows you to control individual field types by specifying
[mapping](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/) during index
or type creation.
