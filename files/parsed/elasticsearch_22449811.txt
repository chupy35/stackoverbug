22449811 Indexing multilingual content in elastisearch

What is the best way to index multilingual content (blog post) in
[elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org/). Should I use a different index for
each language? Different type or create multiple field?

I end up using different types one for each language. This solution works
pretty well.
