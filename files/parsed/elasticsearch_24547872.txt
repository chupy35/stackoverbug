24547872 difference between string syntax query and dsl query

What is the difference between [query-string-
syntax](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax) and a [query-dsl-
queries](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-
api/current/query-dsl-queries.html#bool) like boolean query.

Here is two example

    
    
     field1:value1 AND field2:value2
    

and

    
    
    QueryBuilder qb = QueryBuilders
                        .boolQuery()
                        .must(termQuery("field1", "value1"))
                        .must(termQuery("field2", "value2"));
    

What is the advantage ,disadvantage of both. Which one preferable?

a query-string is the syntax used when you want to query elasticsearch with
the rest api for example when you type :

    
    
    curl -XGET "http://my_ip_adress:9200/my_index/my_type/_search" -d'
    {
      "query": {
        "match_all": {}
      }
    }
    

but query-dsl is used when you're querying elasticsearch with java, so you
will have to use a query builder (like in your post) then something like this
:

    
    
    client
                .prepareSearch(index)
                .setTypes("my_type")
                .setQuery(qb).execute().actionGet();
    

About advantages, the query dsl are more preferable to use in your program
because they are faster. But if you are writing in another language then java,
then you have no choice other then using the restapi.

I hope my answer is clear and precise.
