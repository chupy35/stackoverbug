19435310 Why those ElasticSearch queries doesn't return the same results?

This request returns object:

    
    
    {
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "docId" : "56696636"
        }
    }
    }
    

But this returns nothing:

    
    
    {
    "query" : 
    {
        "bool" : 
        {
            "must" : 
                {
                    "ids" : 
                    {
                        "type" : "docId",
                        "values" : [ "56696636" ]
                    }
                }
        }
    }
    }
    

I'm new in ElasticSearch, but in my opinion both of them should return the
same. Why they don't?

(I'm using elasticsearch 0.90.5)

Sorry, I missed this part of documentation : ids query can be used only to
search by ID
