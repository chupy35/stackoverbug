28464642 Pass properties to recursive templates?

Is there a more elegant solution than re-passing all the properties again when
using recursive templates?

    
    
    <!-- CommentList.js -->
    <Comment comment="comment" property="one" property="two"></Comment>
    
    <!-- Comment.js -->
    <p>{comment.message}</p>
    
    <!-- loop over comment.children (more comments, same properties) -->
        <Comment comment="comment" property="one" property="two"></Comment>
    <!-- end loop -->
    

If you want to transfer the properties you can use [JSX spread
attributes](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-spread.html) to inject
the properties of the parent control into a specified element:

The syntax is similar to a syntax in EcmaScript 6 (and something proposed in
7): `{...props}`.

By using `this.props` for example, you'll get all of the properties of the
parent class copied into the child. (It could be `{...myObj}` as well ... it
will copy values from the object named `myObj` in that example.)

So, in your example, it might be:

    
    
    return <Comment {...this.props} extra="stuff" />;
    

[Here](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/transferring-props.html) are more
details and a few other options you could consider as well.
