18636010 why elasticsearch 0.19.12 stores long as integer

I have this in elasticsearch

    
    
    .startObject("mylongfield").field("type", "long").field("store", "true").field("index", "not_analyzed").endObject()
    
    Map<String, Object> row
    row.put("mylongfield", Long.valueOf("0").longValue());
    OR
    row.put("mylongfield", Long.valueOf(0L).longValue());
    

when i get later the map

    
    
    resultMap = searchHit.sourceAsMap()
    resultMap.get("mylongfield") ... IT IS AN INTEGER ?!?
    

Why is ealsticsearch storing my long as integer?

I've encountered similar behaviour using Elasticsearch 0.90.5 - the value of
the data seems to override the mapping.

The same issue is discussed
[here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/elasticsearch/getsource%2420integer%2420long/elasticsearch/jxIY22TmA8U/PyqZPPyYQ0gJ).
If I understand correctly, this is happening because Elasticseach uses Jackson
to convert the JSON data to a Map, and this is done based on the values. I've
resorted to using instanceof to determine the class of the returned Object.
