23411887 Elasticsearch - Maintaining Document History

I am new to Elasticsearch with a very basic question to ask;

I am planning to use Elasticsearch as a document store and with storing
documents, one of the requirements I have is to maintain historical data as
well.

So I can post documents to Elasticsearch successfully, but when I post an
updated version of the same document - as I've seen - original copy is
overwritten. What I need is to have Elasticsearch keep older copies stored as
well which I should be able to access via specifying a version number.

I have looked at its native support for document versioning which works great
for concurrency control but doesn't look like it keeps a history of previous
versions and only the latest version is available.

Could someone guide me in the right direction here please.

As stated in
[here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-
get.html) ES do not store older versions.

> Note that Elasticsearch do not store older versions of documents. Only the
current version can be retrieved.

You should store the history in a separate index. And insert into the history
index on every update to the original document index.
