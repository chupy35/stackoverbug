21619946 Configure ports in elasticsearch

I am new to elastic search . In elastic search

    
    
      Https ports ranges from 9200-9300 and tcp ports ranges from 9300 to 9400.
      What if i use all  these ports ranges from 9200 to 9400. 
      Will it take new port or throws error.Methodology used to Tcp port calculation?.
      Pls provide me an example.
    

It should be the case as you don't want to run 100 nodes on a single machine.

So I don't really understand what is exactly your concern here.

That said, if you want to change port, have a look at `elasticsearch.yml`
file.

Have a look at:
