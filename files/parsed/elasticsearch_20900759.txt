20900759 Elasticsearch _query vs _search

I have a question which is not quite clear for me when reading the
documentation. What exactly is the difference between the `_search` and the
`_query` Endpoint?

Thanks a lot! Matthias

The `_search` API endpoint allows you to execute a search query and get back
search hits that match the query. The query can either be provided using a
simple query string as a parameter, or using a request body.

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet,user/_search?q=user:kimchy'
    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_search' -d '{
        "query" : {
            "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }
        }
    }
    '
    

The `_query` endpoint, is for delete by query only (I think it only has
handlers for DELETE, not POST, or GET).

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_query?q=user:kimchy'
