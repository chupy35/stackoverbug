28688485 Why we use Bind method on onClick event

I am learning React.js .In the tutorial the author use onClick with bind , but
at some places he do not use the bind with the onClick. I can not get the
difference between the two.

    
    
     <button onClick={this.handleAdd}>Add Item</button>
    

You might use `bind` in order to pass in a certain argument to the handler
method.

For example:

    
    
    render: function() {
        return _.map(list, function(item) {
            return <li onClick={this.clickItem.bind(this, item)}>{item.name}</li>;
        });
    },
    clickItem: function(item, event) {
        //do something with the clicked item
    }
    

If you don't need to inject an argument, you don't need to `bind` since react
always calls the handler method in the scope of the component - [although this
is changing
