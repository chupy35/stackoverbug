22064379 Deleting all documents of a type and keeping the type

I am trying to delete all indices of one type. Tried to execute this :

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/myindex/mytype/_query' -d '{"query": {"match_all": {}}}'
    

But this doesn't delete anything. The following query shows that my index is
still there.

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/myindex/mytype/_search' | json -i
    

What am I doing wrong?

Nevermind. I found this answer myself from this question [Delete records from
Elasticsearch by query](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17676022/delete-
records-from-elasticsearch-by-query)

The body to send with the request is **just** the query. So basically the
right request is :

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/myindex/mytype/_query' -d '{"match_all": {}}'
    

to delete the whole type you call `DELETE` on it

    
    
    curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/myindex/mytype
    

this deletes the type `mytype` in the index `myindex`.

be aware, that this deletes also any mappings etc with the type. but i would
consider this a more resource-friendly way (but can not proove it)
