24502999 Rendering in React.js

I am new to React.js and one question I have is -  Is it necessary to unmount
a React Modal view before re-rendering it.

I am trying to call a react modal view as below. The modal shows up only the
first time. But if the modal is unmounted before this render function is
called, the Modal shows up.

    
    
    render: function(options) {
        React.renderComponent(<ModalView id="ModalView" 
                             model={this.model}/>,$("#"+this.viewId)[0]);
    },
    

Thanks.

Are you using bootstrap modal? I have the same issue. Once rendered the
componentDidMount would not be called. Hence modal would not be shown. I
defined a onClose props to unmount the component on close. If there is a
better way i would be interested.

You should only call `React.renderComponent()` on the root component. To
render a child component just return it in the `render` method.

    
    
    render: function() {
            return <ModalView id="ModalView " model={this.model}/>;
    }
    

And to answer your question, no, you shouldn't need to explicitly unmount
anything. To trigger a render you either `setState`, `setProps` or
`forceUpdate`.
