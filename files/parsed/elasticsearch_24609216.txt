24609216 What is exactly flush in node stats?

When i see the node stat of my cluster using node stats API
http://:9200_nodes/stats?pretty=true

it is show flush like this:

    
    
    "flush" : {
              "total" : 30,
              "total_time_in_millis" : 6964
            }
    

My translog flush interval is 180 minutes or 1200 mb , so i think flush should
be done based on these values & i am sure that i am not reaching 1200 mb
limit.

But if i keep on checking my node stats then flush values (total) are keep on
increasing, so what is it means? is something else also flushing ?

flush also happens based on the number of operations executed. In general, you
shouldn't change the default settings in ES with regards to flush, there are
continuous improvements to the defaults based on the internal enhancements, so
best simply stay with the default. Its quite delicate, and increasing flush
(or making refresh unbounded as another example), can have confusing results,
for example, to a degree where indexing slows down since the indexing thread
in Lucene has to do the internal Lucene flush when it reaches its buffer
limit.
