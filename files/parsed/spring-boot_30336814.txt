30336814 "mvn spring-boot:run": "/health" endpoint with project version

I'd like to use Spring Boot's actuator endpoint `/info` to show project
metadata such as the Maven-provided project version.

To do so, I followed the [appropriate part in Spring Boot's
documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-
boot/docs/1.2.3.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-application-
info-automatic-expansion-maven).

The shown solution works for me when my Spring Boot application starts up with
`java -jar [...]`.

Just as the documentation says, it doesn't work when the application starts up
with `mvn spring-boot:run` -- in that case, my `/info` endpoint reports
`"version":"@project.version@"`.

The documentation mentions that one has to properly configure Spring Boot's
Maven plugin, but I could not find any information about doing so.

How can I configure my Maven project in order to have a `mvn spring-
boot:run`-started Spring Boot application to show project metadata?

Configure the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` with
`<addResources>false</addResources>`.

    
    
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <configuration>
        <addResources>false</addResources>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
