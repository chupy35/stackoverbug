15514114 files indexing automatically by elasticsearch

I am a newbie in elasticsearch, please forgive me if my question sounds weird
:D I want to index files in some directories with elasticsearch automatically
(for example: if i add a file in certain directory then elasticsearch can
index that file immediately), but i don't know how to configure elasticsearch
in order to solve that problem. Can anyone suggest me?

Thank in advance

I dont think you can have elasticsearch watch a directory (I wouldn't think
that is a good thing to do in most cases.)

Instead, have a client wrapper that implements a FileWatcher. Push changes to
ElasticSearch via this client.

You could use
[PathHierarchyTokenizer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-
modules/analysis/pathhierarchy-tokenizer.html) to preserve the file system
hierarchy in your index, allowing you to drill down your Directory structure.
