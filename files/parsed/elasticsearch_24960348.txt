24960348 How to retrieve more data in aggregation?

I am using following aggregation:

    
    
    searchOptions.aggs = {
      categories: {
        terms: {
          field: "CategoryId"
        }
      }
    }
    

This works however I only get `key: 1, docs_count: X` aggregations which is
useless - I have to get also `CategoryName` along with `CategoryId`...

If you want to get category name for that id then,

    
    
    {
       "size": 0,
       "aggs": {
          "category": {
             "terms": {
                "field": "categoryId"
             },
             "aggs":{
                 "categoryName" :{
                     "terms" :{
                         "field" :"categoryName"
                     }
                 }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    

So, sub-aggregation(which is nested in above) gives you categoryName for its
id.
