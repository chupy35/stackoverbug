20403624 Moving an elasticsearch index of one node in a machine to another
drive of the same machine

I have an elasticsearch node in a machine with a 150gb ssd and a 3 tb hdd.
Since I am running out of space in the ssd, I would like to move one index
from the ssd to the hdd. Is this possible? If so how?

I could create another node on the hdd, but I'd rather have one node in the
machine...

Thanks!

You can safely move the data directory (and individual indexes and even
shards) around. We've scp'd entire indexes around in this manner.

You probably should not actively index or delete when you are doing this
though, or unpredictable things could happen.

Once you do the move, you just need to tell elasticsearch where to find data
directory. You set this in the elasticsearch config file found in
/etc/elasticsearch

Just add this setting:

    
    
    path:
      logs: /path/to/log/files
      data: /path/to/data/directory
    

You might want to cp and not mv, just in case things don't go as planed.
