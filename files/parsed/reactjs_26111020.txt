26111020 Use React with a non-browser JS environment

Very open ended, apologies in advance.

I've been going through the docs and searching google incessantly, but I'm
wondering what steps I would need to take to use react with a non-browser
JavaScript environment.

Some context on the environment:

The environment uses JavaScript to run a UI, it has http capabilities. There
is no html, css, document, window, HTMLElement, etc.

The environment does have the notion of a hierarchy, changes to the object
hierarchy in JS cross the bridge and trigger a render through a graphics
platform like OpenGL for instance. The environment does get input via keys and
or a mouse.

If there's a roadmap to do this or something like an architecture diagram to
refer to, that'd be fantastic.

Any help/advice is appreciated.

thanks in advance,

ReactJS work with DOM, so environment need to have DOM structure, that means
no HTML no DOM. Or you can use server render of React component, but you will
get a string as result.
