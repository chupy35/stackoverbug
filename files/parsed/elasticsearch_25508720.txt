25508720 ElasticSearch returning fragments well over the fragment size

I have the following to set my highlighter in elasticsearch

    
    
    { 
      pre_tags: ["<b>"], 
      post_tags: ["</b>"], 
      fields: { 
        title: { number_of_fragments: 0 },                                           
        body:  { number_of_fragments: 1, fragment_size: 200, type: "plain" }
      }
    }
    

however I am occasionally getting the body highlight to be upwards of 300
characters in length and I am unsure why - it's rare, but every now and then a
search result will come through with a really long search fragment.

My temporary fix is that I will truncate the result manually, but I'd prefer
not to do that.
