18321219 get elasticsearch schema via commandline tool

I am trying to get up to speed on an elasticsearch implementation on a
project. How can I see the data that is on the cluster? Is there a commandline
tool that gives me information on the schema?

To get schema:

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://loadtest-appserver1:9200/myIndex/_mapping'
    

See [Elasticsearch Api Doc](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/)

Try using ElasticSearch Head

<http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/>

It's a great tool when peeking in your index and it's meta data (such as the
schema) to find out what's going on.

Also it's HTML5/REST based, so you can take a look in your browser at the
commands it sends to your cluster and use those with command line CURL if
needed.
