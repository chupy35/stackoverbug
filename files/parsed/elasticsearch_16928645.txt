16928645 What exactly does the Standard tokenfilter do in Elasticsearch?

[There are no examples in the
documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-
modules/analysis/standard-tokenfilter/), and I was just wondering what to
expect from input I give it.

Before Elasticsearch 0.16 (Lucene 3.1) the standard token filter was
"normalizing tokens extracted by standard tokenizer". To be specific, it was
removing `'s` at the end of words and dots in acronyms. So, back then
`Apple's` `C.E.O` would become `Apple` `CEO` after passing the standard
filter. Starting with Elasticsearch 0.16 (Lucene 3.1) the standard token
filter does [nothing](https://github.com/apache/lucene-
solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_3/lucene/analysis/common/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardFilter.java#L49)
(at least at the moment). It simply passes tokens to the next filter in the
chain.

Here's an excerpt of the source code of StandardFilter from Lucene trunk. It
really does nothing.

    
    
    public final boolean incrementToken() throws IOException {
        return input.incrementToken(); // TODO: add some niceties for the new grammar
    }
