17424937 Verify database is indexed by Elasticsearch

I'm using Elasticsearch to index and search my db...

  1. How can I verify that the database is indexed? 
  2. If I use the following command:

curl -XGET '<http://localhost:9200/_search?q=whatever>'

the results are:

    
    
    {
      "took": 4,
      "timed_out": false,
      "_shards": {
        "total": 6,
        "successful": 6,
        "failed": 0
      },
      "hits": {
        "total": 0,
        "max_score": null,
        "hits": []
      }
    }
    

How should these results be interpreted?

  1. To check if your db has been indexed, you can try the command:

`curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases'?pretty=true` where you can see
the list of indices and check if yours has been indexed.

  2. The command you used basically searches for the keyword "whatever" in all of the indices.  But it was not able to find anything. Hence you get the following output: The search was successful (depicted by "took":4, "timed_out":false, "_shards":"total":6, "successful":6, "failed":0}) but it did not find anything (depicted by "hits":{"total":0,"max_score":null,"hits":[]})

You can get the list of indices present in your database using the command.
You can see if your index is present in the list. That shows that index has
been created.

    
    
    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&pretty'
    

To check if there are any entries present in your Index. You can get the list
of all the documents using this command.

    
    
    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/INDEX_NAME/_search?v&pretty'
    

In the question that you posted.  "_shards" { "total" : gives how many entries
are present in your index (6 here) } "hits" : { "total" : gives you the
entries that matched your search with keyword whatever (0 here) }
