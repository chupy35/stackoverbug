24034715 Search price between two values with elasticsearch

I would like to send a curl request in order to display my result. I try this
URl on my localhost:

>
localhost:9200/book/book/_search?q=title:wizard&price["10"TO"24"]&pretty=true

My request work, but in my result I see more book with a higher price to $24

if anyone can help me. Thanks in advance.

the `AND` operation is different from `&` which is a query string key-value
separator.

Try this instead:

    
    
    localhost:9200/book/book/_search?q=title:wizard AND price:[10 TO 24]&pretty=true
    

use like this

    
    
    localhost:9200/book/book/_search?q=title:wizard AND price:[10 to 24]&pretty=true
    

HOpe it helps..!
