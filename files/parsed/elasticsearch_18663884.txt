18663884 How can I get fuzzy results sorted by relevance using ElasticSearch?

Baiscally if I search for something like

    
    
    neckla
    

I want to get results for necklace. When i did a fuzzy search, I got results
for food and others (basically it wasn't filtering properly) although the
necklace result was there.

Any advice?

Have you adjusted the min_similarity parameter in your fuzzy query? Increasing
the min_similarity may filter out the food and only return the necklace.

    
    
    {
        "fuzzy" : { 
            "jewelry" : {
                "value" : "neckla",
                "boost" : 1.0,
                "min_similarity" : 0.8,
                "prefix_length" : 0
            }
        }
    }
    

As mentioned in the [answer to this
question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18690127/how-can-i-get-results-
that-dont-fully-match-using-elasticsearch), an edgeNGram filter may be your
best bet here.
