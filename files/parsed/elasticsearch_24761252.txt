24761252 Why my suggest call does not return any matches?

I have `post` type which has field `title`. For now there are following
titles:

    
    
    "post title 1"
    "post title 2"
    "post title 3"
    ...
    "post title 200"
    

In `post` mapping there is:

    
    
    properties:
        ...
        title:
            type: "string"
        ...
    

I am able to search for post title however following suggest request does not
return any matches:

    
    
    {
    "index-name": {
        "text": "post",
        "phrase" : {
            "field" : "title"
        }
    }   
    }
    

result:

    
    
    {
        "_shards": {
            "total": 1,
            "successful": 1,
            "failed": 0
        },
        "index-name": [
            {
                "text": "post",
                "offset": 0,
                "length": 4,
                "options": []
            }
        ]
    }
    

I use `POST .../index-name/_suggest` endpoint It also fails for text `"1"`,
`"200"` etc

I guess I have to update mapping to let know elastic that I want to use this
field for suggestions, however I can't find it anywhere in docs...

You should use "completion" type instead of "string" for title.

And try to search for "post" text.
