17042018 Can I change a field from "not indexed" to "indexed" in
elasticsearch?

If I have a field that has "index":"no" and i already inserted some documents,
Is there a way to change the index settings (to "analyzed" or "not_analyzed")
and let the nodes crunch a little until they create the index?

No, elasticsearch won't "reindex" internally if you update the mappings. You
have to reindex all documents.
