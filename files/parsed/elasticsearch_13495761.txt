13495761 ElasticSearch position in index

I'm considering the use of Elasticsearch to build a rank. If I index a list of
elements that is ordered according to a score. Can I query by an element name
and get its position on the Index?

e.g i build an index with two elements:

"Element1", score: 8 "Element2", score: 7 "Element3", score: 10

When I query by "Element2" I would like to obtain position = 3

Elasticsearch doesn't know the place until it actually collects results and it
collects results only to send them back to client. So, there is really no way
to just get the place without going through results until you find the
document you are looking for. If sending all these results to client doesn't
work for you, you can write a plugin that will do it on the server side.
