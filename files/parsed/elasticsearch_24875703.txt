24875703 Elasticsearch change similarities model of an index

Can you change the similarities model of an index or do you need to rebuild
the index?

This documents the similarities plugin,
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-
modules-similarity.html>

But the documentation does not mention if you are able to change the model on
the fly.

Thanks

Chris

At the moment elasticsearch does not allow changing the similarity on the fly
. <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/4403>
