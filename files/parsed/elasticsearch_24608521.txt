24608521 how to modify the type mapping in elasticsearch to another type

The thing is that I already defined a field "myvalue" as INTEGER. Now I think
was a mistake and I want to store in the same field an string, so I want to
change it, without loosing data, to STRING. is there any way of making it?, or
I need to re-create the index and re-index the whole data?

I already tried running:

    
    
    {
        "mappings": {
            "myvalue": {
                               "type":"string"
    }
        }
    }
    

But if I get the mapping again from the server still appear as Integer

There is not any way to change the mapping on a core field type for existing
data. You will need to re-create the index with the `myvalue` field defined as
a string and re-index your data.
