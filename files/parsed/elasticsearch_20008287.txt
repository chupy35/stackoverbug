20008287 Is it possible to get response with highlighted "_source" instead of
"highlight" collection?

It would be nice in some cases (I have fixed amount of fields to display on
search result and to create logic that would replace one field from
"highlight" collection and the second one leave original is somehow
uncomfortable). Is it possible?

    
    
    "hits": [
         {
            "_index": "myindex",
            "_type": "Company",
            "_id": "da8b8f36-3454-4120-9194-e5355819bff4",
            "_score": 1.214946,
            "_source": {
               "id": "1",
               "name": "The <em>Company</em>"
         }
    

Thanks in advance?

It is not possible, since highlighting is a feature available with the search
api but doesn't replace your search results.

You need to get the snippets from the highlighted results, and fall back to
the `_source` if there are no snippets available for the fields you are
interested in. The recently introduced `no_match_size` parameter might be
useful to you though, as it allows to include in the highlighted results the
first part of a field if there was nothing to highlight, so that the fallback
is effectively done by elasticsearch itself internally.
