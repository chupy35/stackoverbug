17763933 Searching within a string

I would like to create a new query or modify this one:

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/my_index/_search?/pretty=true' -d ' 
    {
      "fields" : ["city", "element_name", "organization"],
      "query" : {
        "bool" : {
          "must" : [
        {
              "match" : { "organization" : "MyOrganizationName" }
            },        
        { 
              "query_string" : {
                "query" : "Input",
                "fields" : [ "element_name", "city"]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "filter" : {
        "type" : {"value" : "Project"}
      }
    }'
    

To the point, where it can search mongodb with these criteria:

  * Input: "tring" -> finds "String" or "Longer String"
  * Input: "Longer" or "String" -> finds "Longer String"

I haven't changed `query_string` to `match`, because I substitute desired
functionality with `*`.

I was also wondering, whether analyzer might come handy, however I have no
idea how to set it up. How can I do this?
