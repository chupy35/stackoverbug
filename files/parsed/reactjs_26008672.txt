26008672 Using react.js with custom native DOM events

How do you access native dom events with react?

The [documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html) says "If
you find that you need the underlying browser event for some reason, simply
use the **nativeEvent** attribute to get it.

How do you use the nativeEvent attribute?

I tried onDelete={this.handleDelete} but it doesn't seem to get triggered. I
can bind the event with jQuery so I know it's firing.

React doesn't support custom DOM events. You have two options:

  * use a [regular event emitter](https://www.npmjs.org/package/events)
  * add custom event handlers using jQuery

Either of these should be wrapped into a mixin, and don't forget to remove the
listeners in componentWillUnmount. The jQuery option is a last resort.
