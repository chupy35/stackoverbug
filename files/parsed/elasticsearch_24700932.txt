24700932 Elasticsearch: how to allow multi-language searches?

I am new to Elasticsearch. I posted a question called

Elasticsearch: Use a separate index for each language of the same data record

Here is the link: [Elasticsearch: Use a separate index for each language of
the same data
record](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24685864/elasticsearch-use-a-
separate-index-for-each-language-of-the-same-data-record)

The posted answer mentions "allowing multi-language searches". I am confused
about it. I read book "Elasticsearch server (2nd edition)" and did not see
this topic. I just did a google search and was unable to see anything related
online.

Does anyone happen to have any links about "allowing multi-language searches"?
Is this a configuration thing? How?

Thanks so much for any input!

Regards.

You donâ€™t need to have different indexes for each language. Say you had a
'product' type that could have the title field in German or French or both,
you would need to index the French title differently from the German title by
using different analyzers. In your mapping specify what analyzers you want to
use:

    
    
    {
        "product": {
            "properties": {
                "title": {
                    "properties": {
                        "de": {
                          "type": "string",
                          "analyzer": "de_analyzer"
                        },
                        "fr": {
                          "type": "string",
                          "analyzer": "fr_analyzer"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

Index your documents

    
    
    curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/yourindex/product/1' -d
    '{
        "title": {
            "fr": "Bonjour"
        }
    }'
    
    curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/yourindex/product/2' -d
    '{
        "title" : {
            "de": "Hallo"
        }
    
    }'
    

When you want to do a search on the French title you would reference it in the
query

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/yourindex/_search?q=title.fr:bonjour
    

When you want to do a search on the German title:

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/yourindex/_search?q=title.de=hallo
    

If you want to search of both of the fields you can use a multi_field search:

    
    
    {
        "query":{
            "multi_match" : {
                "query": "bonjour hallo", 
                "fields": [ "title.fr", "title.de" ] 
            }
        }
    } 
    

This blog will give you a good idea of how to use the analyzers for earch
language you want to index:
