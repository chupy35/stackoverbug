31550636 Spring Boot safety of application.properties

is it safe to put in file application.properties security data, for example
connection to my DB. for Example:

    
    
    db.driver: org.postgresql.Driver
    db.url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test
    db.username: postgres
    db.password: root
    

With safe I mean that data inside that file are not visible from web.
