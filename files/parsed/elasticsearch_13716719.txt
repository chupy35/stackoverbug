13716719 Elasticsearch URI based query with AND operator

How do I specify AND operation in URI based query? I'm looking for something
like:

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/_search?q="profiletype:student AND username:s*"
    

According to documentation, it should work as you described it. See
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/query-string-
query.html>

That said, you can also use the following:

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/_search?q="+profiletype:student +username:s*"
    

For [URI
search](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
uri-request.html) in ElasticSearch, you can use either the AND operator
`profiletype:student AND username:s`, as you say but without quotes:

    
    
      _search?q=profiletype:student AND username:s*
    

You can also set the default operator to `AND`

    
    
      _search?q=profiletype:student username:s*&default_operator=AND
    

Or you can use the `+`
[operator](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-query-string-query.html) for terms that must be present, i.e. one would
use `+profiletype:student +username:s` as query string. This doesn't work
without URL encoding, though. In URL encoding `+` is `%2B`and space is `%20`,
therefore the alternative would be

    
    
      _search?q=%2Bprofiletype:student%20%2Busername:s*
    

i had to combine the default operator and + sign to make it work

    
    
    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/apm/inventory/_search?default_operator=AND&q=tenant_id:t2+_all:node_1'
    

You can try bellow line.

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/_search?q=profiletype:student%20AND%20username:s*
    
    http://localhost:9200/_search?q=profiletype:student AND username:s*
