26470030 How can I access query parameters for the Health endpoint?

I'm trying to pass a query parameter to the health endpoint. Is this possible?
For example, `http://localhost/health?id=asdfasdf`

I want to access the id in the health() method.

    
    
    @Override
    public Health health() {
       //access id here.
    }
    

Thanks,

Jerry

A Spring Boot endpoint is designed to be exposed to clients via a number of
different techniques. For example both HTTP and JMX are supported out of the
box. This means that using something that's HTTP-specific in an endpoint isn't
a good idea.

That said, if you _really_ want to provide a `HealthIndicator` that's HTTP-
specific you should be able to use Spring's `RequestContextHolder` to get hold
of a `ServletRequestAttributes` instance for the current request. From there
you can access the `HttpServletRequest` and call `getQueryString()`:

    
    
    String queryString = (((ServletRequestAttributes) RequestContextHolder
                .getRequestAttributes()).getRequest().getQueryString());
