23845315 Spring Boot Actuator in the traditional container

Can we use the Spring Boot Actuator in the traditional shared container within
the context of an application? If so, how would be the configuration look
like?

I have tried it by bootstrapping `EndpointWebMvcAutoConfiguration`. However,
could not map mvc urls.

There's nothing stopping you from just using it as a dependency. Any Spring
Boot app should be able to use actuator features out of the box.
