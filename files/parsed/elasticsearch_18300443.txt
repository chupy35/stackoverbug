18300443 How to GET the child record from parent child in ElasticSearch?

I simply would like to GET the child record directly after inserting both the
Parent and the Child. Must I do a search query to just get the child or can I
just do a standard GET with just the index, type, id of the child record?

thanks

Answer: you need to add the routing parameter with the parent ID to retrieve
the child record.

Yes, you can just do a standard GET on the child `index`, `type` and `id`, but
as _user983022_ mentioned, you'll need to use the `parent_id` as the `routing`
parameter in your request, otherwise ES will likely look on the wrong shard
for the child document.

For more information on parent/child and routing, read
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/customizing-your-document-routing/> and
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/get/> mentions using the
`routing` parameter in `GET` requests.
