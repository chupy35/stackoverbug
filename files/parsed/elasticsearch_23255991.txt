23255991 Elasticsearch - Sorting by a nested multi-field

I've run into a problem while trying to sort on nested multi-field properties
in Elasticsearch. One of the two multi-fields works, the other returns null
for every value.

My sortable analyzer:

    
    
        "analyzer": {
            "sortable": {
                "type": "custom",
                "tokenizer": "keyword",
                "filter": ["lowercase"]
            }
        }
    

Mapping:

    
    
    {
        "doc": {
            "properties": {
                "id" : {
                    "type": "long"
                },
                "name": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "index": "analyzed",
                    "analyzer": "snowball",
                    "fields": {
                        "sortable": { 
                            "type": "string",
                            "analyzer": "sortable"
                        }
                    }
                },
                "website": {
                    "type": "nested",
                    "properties": {
                        "domain": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "analyzer": "snowball",
                            "fields": {
                                "sortable": { 
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "analyzer": "sortable"
                                }
                            }
                        },
                        "created": {
                            "type": "date"
                        }
                    }
                } 
            }
        }
    }
    

A full working example is
[here](http://sense.qbox.io/gist/92524e522f5096f98c59cc6f2da7ffa213433536).
Note the four searches at the bottom. Sorting by name or name.sortable both
show values in the sort section of the result. Sorting by website.domain shows
a value in the sort section, but website.domain.sortable always shows null.

I'm hoping I'm just doing something silly here, but for the life of me I can't
see what. This is in Elasticsearch 1.1.0. I'll gladly also take alternative
solutions, though I hate to just slap the field in there twice under two
different names.

You need to require a path for sorting on nested document types.
