10783994 search stops after the first match

I have `attribute_set_id` indexed at two different places in each id. I want
to search and get results from both the places(actually I want from the second
one). What is happening now, is that the following query searches only for the
first instance of "attribute_set_id" and when does not find the match, returns
zero.  
`{"query":{terms:{attribute_set_id:["Bags"]}}}'`
