15980422 Elasticsearch autocomplete and searching against multiple term fields

I'm integrating elasticsearch into an asset tracking application. When I setup
the mapping initially, I envisioned the 'brand' field being a single-term
field like 'Hitachi', or 'Ford'. Instead, I'm finding that the brand field in
the actual data contains multiple terms like: "MB 7 A/B", "B-7" or even "Brush
Bull BB72X".

I have an autocomplete component setup now that I configured to do
autocomplete against an edgeNGram field, and perform the actual search against
an nGram field. It's completely useless the way I set it up because users
expect the search results to be restricted to what the autocomplete matches.

Any suggestions on the best way to setup my mapping to support autocomplete
and subsequent searches against a multiple term field like this? I'm
considering a terms query against a keyword field, or possibly a match query
with 'and' as the operator? I also have to deal with hyphens like "B-7".
