ElasticSearch: Which query can be used for the following result: input query:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-bool-query.html>

An example query of what you want to do is :

    
    
    {
      "bool" : {
    
        "must" : [
            {
                "prefix" : { "term1" : "prefix2" }
            },
            {
                "prefix" : { "term2" : "prefix2" }
            }
        ]
      }
    }
