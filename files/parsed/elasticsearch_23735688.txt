23735688 Optional Parent Relation in Elasticsearch

**Example:** Some items belong to specific users. The User is the parent, the
item is the child. Indexing those items and users can be done by routing the
items to the shards of the users.

**Problem:** The majority of items does not belong to a specific user since
they have been posted anonymously. I could have those items routed to a
parent-id:"anonymous", but that would lead to the majority of items being
stored in one single shard.

**Question:** How can I introduce optional parent-child-relations so that
items belonging to a registered user route to the users shard, while anonymous
items get distributed randomly?

Store them in two different indexes and search both.
