reference-the-property-name-within-an-ng-repeat)

I have a JSON file like that:

    
    
    fields: {
        alias: {
            type: "string",
        },
        name: {
            type: "string",
        }
    }
    

I want something like that:

    
    
    <dl ng-repeat="for field in fields.items">
        <dt>
            {{ field.key }}
        </dt>
        <dd>
            {{ field.value }}
        </dd>
    </dl>
    

thanks in advance!

according to ngRepeat docs you can use "(key, value) in expression" as
parameters â€“ where key and value can be any user defined identifiers, and
expression is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.

For example: (name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}.
