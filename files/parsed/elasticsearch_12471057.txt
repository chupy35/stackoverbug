12471057 What score should i put in boost field of elasticsearch

In my doc, I have a field called Tag and SuperTag. Whenever a Tag matches it
will boost some score, but if a match on SuperTag it will boost significantly
to make it 1st choice. In your opinion, what value should I put in boost field
for Tag and SuperTag? Thanks.

That's quite difficult to be answered, It depends so much in the data that
both field contains and the analyzers that they have.

Obviously if the data is going to be pretty much the same for both I would set
a boost in supertag field to `2.0`.

In case they don't hold the same data we can imagine scenarios like this:

    
    
    {tag: 'tagnice tagnice tagnice'}
    
    {supertag: 'tagnice'}
    

even with the boosted supertag, tag could be more relevant just because `tf-
idf` gives it bigger score.

To solve that for example, an analyzer setted to both with filter unique will
help.

So as said, it depends so much in the data and how you store it in lucene. At
first sight, without knowing that much, doubling the boost would work.
