21968297 Removing commas when using whitespace tokenizer

When using the whitespace tokenizer a text like "there, he is." would be split
to  "there," "he" and "is.". Naturally I would want to remove those
punctuation that the standard tokenizer would had removed automatically.

My questions are:

  1. How to trim those punctuation marks? (in elasticsearch setting, like adding another token filter or charfilter)
  2. I need to use the whitespace tokenizer mainly because I don't want hyphenated words to be splited. Is there a way I can achieve this while still using the standard tokenizer?

you can use split() to remove all punctuation marks

    
    
    String str ="there, he is.";
    String[] ss = str.split("[ ,.]");   
    for (String string : ss) {
    System.out.println(string);
    }
    

try this this will help u

You can use the char filter to remove the the ",". [Char
