16078400 ES search query call and return only selected fields

I'm trying to write a query for Elastic Search that would return the first 20
closest matches.

I want to return the first 20 matches for the title field.

    
    
    curl -X POST "localhost:9200/xxx/_search?pretty=true" -d '
    {
    "from" : 0,
    "size" : 20,
    "query" : { "term" : {"title" : "art"} }}'
    

What am I missing here?

Update:

I'm trying to get only the 'title' field returned, not the whole object.

I got this by doing a search with fields param:

    
    
    curl -X POST "localhost:9200/xxx/_search?pretty=true" -d '
    {
    "from" : 0,
    "size" : 20,
    "fields" : ["title"],
    "query" : { "term" : {"title" : "art"} }}'
