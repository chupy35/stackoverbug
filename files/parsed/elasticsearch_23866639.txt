23866639 "SHOW VARIABLES" query in elasticsearch

Is there a way to query the list of effective configuration variables
(defaults + configured values) just like a "SHOW VARIABLES" statement in
MySQL?

The
[_settings](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
get-settings.html) endpoint provides a simple way to retrieve the customized
configuration for a given index.

Mapping defaults can only be printed for specific fields calling

`GET /index/_mapping/type/field/content?include_defaults=true`

where _index_ , _type_ and _content_ have to be replaced with the relevant
names.
