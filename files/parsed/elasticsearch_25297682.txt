25297682 how to avoid elasticsearch process being swapped on Windows servers?

From elasticsearch's
website(<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/referenc>â€¦), it
recommends to disable memory swapping for better performance . But the
approaches are for Linux only. We are planning to run the elasticsearch on
Windows servers. Can we simply disable the page file on Windows? Any tips how
to do this?

ElasticSearch team is working (as of 2015-04-06) on implementing VirtualLock
on Windows:
