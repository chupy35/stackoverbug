31430693 Spring Boot Server using HTTPS, Management Server only HTTP?

Based on an answer from @andy-wilkinson to a past Spring Boot
[question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28686229/when-customizing-the-
management-server-port-how-is-this-implemented), it appears that with the
exception of a couple parameters (port for example), the management server
leverages the same configuration as the regular servlet container.

I would like to configure the main Spring Boot server to use HTTPS (for the
application/service it is serving) and to use just HTTP for the actuator
endpoints. Has anyone done this? Is this even possible?

It's not possible at the moment. Please [open an
issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/new) if it's an
enhancement that you'd like to see.
