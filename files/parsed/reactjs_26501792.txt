26501792 Rid of repeated spans in React.js?

React renders multiple spans, only with the actual value. Any advice on how to
fix this:

And if it matter, the name of the user isn't suppose to be in a span, but as
innerHTML of ".chatUser"

The actual render method is short:

    
    
    createShortUsername: function() {
     // shortName is first two letter of first name. 
     var shortName = this.props.userName.split(" ")[0].slice(0, 2);
     console.log(shortName);
     return shortName;
    },
    render: function() {
     return (
       <div className="chatUser"> {this.createShortUsername()} </div>
     );
    }
    

Thanks!

As suggested by @ivarni, the extra spans were caused by white spaces!

To prevent this write your code without white spaces around the braced
expressions.

    
    
    <ReactElement>{noRoomForWhiteSpace}</ReactElement>
    

Its actually some special characters(non visible in your editor) that creeps
into the code.(Likely if you had copy-pasted). For me it was `\u2028`. Check
the generated javascript file to see what extra characters got into the code.
To get rid of it, you could remove the line that caused it and type it again(
as opposed to copying and pasting)
