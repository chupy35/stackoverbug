19870550 Getting the oldest and newest elasticsearch index

Does elasticsearch have an API to return the creation timestamp of an index
(or sort by it)? I want to delete the oldest 'n' indexes of some "index-type"
and restrict some queries to only the newest index. The naming convention that
I use for indexes is something like:
`<indextype>_<client_hostname>_<batch_name>.`

Yes, it has a [`_timestamp`
field](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
timestamp-field.html). It is disabled by default, though, so you will need to
enable it, using a mapping such as that provided in the documentation, with:
`"_timestamp" : { "enabled" : true }`

The `_timestamp` field is per document. If you retrieve the oldest document
based on the `_timestamp` it might help, but the index could have been
previously created using the create index api. In fact, an index is by default
automatically created when you index the first document into it (unless you
disable this behaviour), but you can also create an index upfront.

I think I would add the timestamp to the name of the index too and manage this
outside of elasticsearch. Remember that you can also close an index without
deleting the data if you need to.
