21560805 source filtering not working in elasticsearch 1.0.0.beta

according to the docs, it is possible to do source filtering on the returned
document beginning with elasticseach 1.0.0beta

I tried all the examples from the url below, but the source is always
completely returned. Also, when sending _source:false, the whole document is
still returned as well.

Is this a known issue?

found the solution. Needed to use POST instead of PUT
