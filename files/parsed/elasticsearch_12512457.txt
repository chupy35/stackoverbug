12512457 Querying indexed data on elasticsearch

I had indexed data on elastic search with terms like "name",and "message". Now
I want to apply query on indexed data in such a way that I want to find
frequency (count) of a certain pharse used in the message. For example
messages are "I like to eat sandwich","I like to eat burger" etc,,,Now i want
to query that how many times "like to" pharse is used in all the indexed
messages.

Sounds like you are looking for the Terms Facet API. See here :
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/facets/terms-
facet.html>

You can filter your facet with a specific term if you need too. See "Facet
Filter" on the following page :
