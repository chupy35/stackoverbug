21747059 Regex on multiple terms

First of all, I'm very new to ElasticSearch.

I've indexed 10m documents with the only string in ElasticSearch. This string
contains terms/words, separated with space:

    
    
    1:1 2 2 2 3 1:2 1:3
    

Every word is a code of an event, generated by some device. The string /
document, itself, is a sequence of all events, generated by that device.

I need to find all documents/devices, that follow some patters/sequence of
events. E.g.:

    
    
    1:1 -> 1:2 -> 1:3
    

I do a regex search in ElasticSearch:

    
    
    {
        query: {
            bool: {
                must: [
                {
                    query_string: {
                        default_field: "device.event",
                        query: "1:1.*1:2"
                    }
                }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    

It works fine - returns 1 document. However, when I do the query below, no
matches are found:

    
    
    {
        query: {
            bool: {
                must: [
                {
                    query_string: {
                        default_field: "device.event",
                        query: "1:1.*1:3"
                    }
                }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    

With `.*` I want to skip all terms, between `1:1` and `1:3`, but, apparently,
it doesn't work.
