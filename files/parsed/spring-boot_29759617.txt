29759617 Making spring boot boostrap behind proxy

I tried to use Spring Boot using proxy.

I get the following message

    
    
    $ spring init -l
    
    Failed to retrieve help from service at 'https://start.spring.io'
    (start.spring.io: unknown error)
    

I tried following

    
    
    export http_proxy
    
    export https_proxy
    
    JAVA_OPTS settings
    

We are using commons `HttpClient` and we build a default instance via
[HttpClientBuilder](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-
ga/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/impl/client/HttpClientBuilder.html)

There are a bunch of system properties that are taken into account but I
assume the following is the ones you're looking for:

  * `http.proxyHost`
  * `http.proxyPort`

Can you try that? If that does not work, please raise an issue on [the boot
tracker](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues)

Behind corporate proxy using locally installed
[cntlm](http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/) proxy:

    JAVA_OPTS 
    -Dhttp.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttp.proxyPort=3128 -Dhttps.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128
    

Output:

    
    
    $ spring init
    Using service at https://start.spring.io
    Content saved to 'demo.zip'
    

Use

> -Dhttp.proxyHost=your.proxy.net -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080
