8234704 MasterNotDiscoveredException in Elastic Search when creating an index

I've followed the simple tutorial to install elastic-search on a clean debian
lenny machine:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/tutorials/2010/07/02/setting-up-elasticsearch-
on-debian.html>

However, when trying to create index with mapping:

    
    
    curl -XPUT "localhost:9200/searchdata" -d @index.json
    

I get this error:

    
    
    {"error":"MasterNotDiscoveredException[]","status":500}
    

I've used the `index.json` on another instance of ES, so I know that it works.
I'm assuming I'm missing something the the ES config file. currently I have
this:

    
    
    cluster:
      name:   MyCluster
    
    network:
      host:   _eth0_
    

As docs are pretty scarce for ES, I thought I'd see if anyone can lead me to a
solution. Thanks in advance.

Not sure the issue, but a clean install of the OS fixed it.
