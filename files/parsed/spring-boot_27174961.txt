27174961 How to combine multiple Spring Boot web applications?

I came across this tutorial "[Building microservices with Spring
Boot](http://plainoldobjects.com/2014/04/01/building-microservices-with-
spring-boot-part1/)", which explains how to connect a user registration
service with a webapp (=an UI for the registration). And I wondered if I could
connect two webapps?

Say I have several components:

  1. a forum
  2. a chat
  3. a blog system
  4. ...

Each of them is a separately developed webapp with API endpoints, backend
logic, enclosed Tomcat etc. I want to combine them within an app depending on
what component is required. Maybe I even want to override certain aspects
(e.g. configuration or a default template) within the enclosing project.

Any buzzwords for how to do this?

Basic idea of micro services is to avoid monolithic application architecture.
In your scenario you are trying make it large single application. That means
when chat goes down, forum goes down and so on. Thats the basic issue micro
services trying to solve, try to avoid such situation.

Regardless, if you want to combine many applications you may need to publish
chat, forum etc as separate maven artifact modules and then include each one
of them as dependency in one sprint boot projec. Now you will have one
application server and many modules running in it.
