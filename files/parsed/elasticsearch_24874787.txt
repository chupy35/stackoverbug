24874787 How do I configure elasticsearch to retain documents up to 30 days?

Is there a default data retention period in elasticsearch? If yes can you help
me find the configuration?

Yeah you can set a TTL on the data. Take a look here for the configuration
options available.

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
ttl-field.html>

This is no longer supported in Elasticsearch 5.0.0 or greater. The best
practice is to create indexes periodically (daily is most common) and then
delete the index when the data gets old enough.

Here's a reference to how to delete an index
(<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
delete-index.html>)

This article (though it's old enough to reference _ttl) also gives some
insight: <https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-elasticsearch-and-logstash-to-
serve-billions-of-searchable-events-for-customers>

As a reminder, it's best to protect your Elasticsearch cluster from the
outside world via a proxy and restrict the methods that can be sent to your
cluster. This way you can prevent your cluster from being ransomed.

Elasticsearch curator is the tool to use if you want to manage your indexes:

Here's an example of how to delete indices based on age:

Combine with cron to have this done at regular intervals.
