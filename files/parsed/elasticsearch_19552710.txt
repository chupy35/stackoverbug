19552710 DateHistogram Facet return ZERO if nothing took place at certain time

I am using a date histogram to get the count per hour of some messages in
elastic search.  However the date histogram facet will only show the count per
hour in the hours were some activity took place. Is there a way to force it to
return zero if no activity happened during that interval.

This is just how it works, we have some code in place on our end to populate
missing "buckets" with zeros. I'm not sure yet if this is a good design
decision or a bug - perhaps open an issue for it on
<http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch> ?
