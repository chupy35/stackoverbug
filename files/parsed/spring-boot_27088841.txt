27088841 Disable SSLv3 using Spring-Boot and embedded Tomcat

I'm using Spring-Boot-1.1.8, and I configured ssl with the following
properties

    
    
    server.ssl.key-alias=XXX
    server.ssl.key-password=XXX
    server.ssl.key-store=classpath:XXX
    server.ssl.key-store-provider=XXX
    server.ssl.key-store-type=XXX.jks
    server.ssl.protocol=TLS
    

even though the SSL protocol is TLS, SSLv3 appears to be enabled . Is it a
bug, or I'm missing something?

Just a reminder, using SSLv3, the server may be impacted by the Poodle
vulnerability.

If your goal is to disable SSLv3, the easiest option is to use Tomcat 7.0.57
which disables it by default. Assuming you're using Maven, all you need to do
is set the `tomcat.version` property to 7.0.57 in your pom.

The forthcoming Spring Boot 1.1.10 release uses 7.0.57 by default so, once
it's been released, you'll no longer need to set the Tomcat version.
