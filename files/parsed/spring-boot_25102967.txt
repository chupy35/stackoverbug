25102967 Groovy Template Engine rendering contents

I'm trying to separate some contents in the body section of my _layout.tpl_.
For instance, I have carousel slider in my _index.tpl_ , but it's not
necessary to include it inside the _login.tpl_. Moreover, I need to add
another page specific contents too. So, _layout.tpl_ , and _index.tpl_ are
like in the following:

**layout.tpl**

    
    
      body {
        headerContents()
        div(class:'container') {
            div(class:'row') {
                div(class:'col-lg-12') {
                    content()
                }
            }
        }
      }
    

**index.tpl**

    
    
    layout 'layouts/layout.tpl',
    title:'Home',
    headerContents: contents {
       h1('Test Header')
    }
    content: contents {
       h1('Test Content')
    }
    

But `h1('Test Content)` cannot be rendered. I checked the docs but I couldn't
find anything about how to render two different contents. Does template engine
support to do this or not?
