24244254 Dynamic mapping for suggest field in Elastic Search

I have the following dynamic mapping:

    
    
        "mappings": {
            "_default_": {
                "dynamic_templates": [
                    {
                        "suggest_template": {
                            "mapping": {
                                "suggest": {
                                    "type": "completion",
                                    "index_analyzer": "simple",
                                    "search_analyzer": "simple",
                                    "payloads": true
                                }
                            },
                            "match": "suggest"
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "properties": {}
            }    
    }
    

This mapping should, as far as I understand, map all fields called suggest to
the completion type.

However when I index documents all of the fields named suggest are indexed as
type string:

    
    
    "properties": {
    
                    "suggest": {
                        "type": "string"
                    }
     }
    

**Does anyone know why this mapping isn't working?**

p.s. To set this into a scope. The end use case for this is to use the
completion suggester. As this mapping doesn't work I get the following error:

    
    
    ElasticsearchException[Field [suggest] is not a completion suggest field]
    

Just found the problem with the mapping. The "suggest_template": and brackets
should be removed.
