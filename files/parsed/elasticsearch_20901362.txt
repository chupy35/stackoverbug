20901362 Elasticsearch with two nodes and the default 5 shards?

I have set up a cluster with two nodes but I have some confusions about shard
and replica.

What I intend is a setup where there is a master(node A) handling write and a
slave(node B) that helps with read and search operation. Ideally if the master
is not functional I can recover the data from the slave.

I read that the default is 5 shards and 1 replica. Does it mean that my
primary data would then be automatically split between node A and node B.
Would that means if one node is down I would lost half the data?

Given the description of my need above, am I doing it right?  The only config
I have changed at this point is the following

    
    
    cluster:
      name: maincluster
    node:
      name: masternode
      master: true
    

I am really new to elasticsearch and please kindly point out if I am missing
anything.

5 shards and 1 replica means that your data will be split into 5 shards per
index.  Each shard will have one replica (5 more backup shards) for a total of
10 shards spread across your set of nodes.

The replica shard will be placed onto a different node than the primary shard
(so that if one node fails you have redundancy).

With 2 nodes and replication set to 1 or more, losing a node will still give
you access to all of your data, since the primary shard and replication shard
will not ever be on same node.

I would install the [elasticsearch head
plugin](https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head) it provides a very
graphical view of nodes and shards (primary and replica).
