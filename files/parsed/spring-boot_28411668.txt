28411668 Spring Boot and Jboss wildfly setting the context root

I am trying to set the context root of my spring boot application. I'm
deploying my application as a war file to Jboss.  i've tried to set the
contextPath of what I'd like my root URL to be when deploying it to
JBoss/Wildfly but it seems to get ignored. Unless I add a jboss-web.xml file
setting a contex-root variable, my deployment url is always based on teh war
file name:

e.g. : myapp.war always deploys as : localhost:8080/myapp unless I use jboss-
web. I've tried setting the contextPath in the server.properties file and it
doesn't seem to work.

My question is should I be able to? I'm using the latest Spring Boot.

All of the `server.*` properties that Spring Boot supports only apply to the
configuration of the embedded servlet container (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow).
If you're deploying your Spring Boot app to a standalone server then you'll
need to configure that server using whatever mechanisms it provides.

In other words, add your `jboss-web.xml`

file in this directory : `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF`

Content of your jboss-web.xml

    
    
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <jboss-web>
            <context-root>/</context-root>
    </jboss-web>
