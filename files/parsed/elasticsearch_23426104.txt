23426104 Same index data but different store size in ElasticSearch?

I am evaluating the necessary storage size required by ElasticSearch. However,
I find that the store size varies every time while indexing the same set of
data.

For example, the size of the data I used is 35mb. The indexing ran for several
times, and the result store sizes are between 76mb ~ 85mb, not a fixed number
(not repeatable?)

Can someone explain this? Thanks in advance:)

After you've inserted all of your data, have you tried doing an optimze
(<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
optimize.html>) to bring the number of segments down to 1?

Basically the time at which it does the Lucene segment merges causes the
differences in sizes you are seeing. They are not deterministic because once
the merge kicks off, the amount of data you insert before the merge completes
affects the size of the remaining segments. You can read a little more about
the segment merges here:
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-
modules-merge.html> and here: [Understanding Segments in
Elasticsearch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15426441/basics-about-
segments-in-elasticsearch)
