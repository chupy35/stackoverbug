17773524 Elasticsearch mongodb river tailable curosr issue

I am using elasticsearch, mongodb and elasticsearch mongodb river

> <https://github.com/richardwilly98/elasticsearch-river-mongodb>

When I observe my mongodb logs the river keeps on querying the oplog of my
elasticsearch even when it is not indexing the documents and also it is taking
long time to finish indexing the collection.

Any guidance on the above mentioned issues?

elasticsearch mongodb river [1] uses the recommended way [2] to query tailable
cursor in MongoDB

If you observe extra query in oplog.rs I'd suggest to try contacting MongoDB
and especially MongoDB Java Driver [3].

I am happy to fix any issue in elasticsearch mongodb river.
