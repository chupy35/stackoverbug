15779141 What's the performance difference between Elasticsearch _all field
search and multi-match

I know Elasticsearch enables _all field as default. But for some reason
(scoring) I don't want to use it. Instead I use multi_match, where I have
almost 10 fields. Is the performance of multi_match worse than _all field? And
how much?

IMHO, it depends more on the query than on the field itself. I think, you are
talking about `query_string` which by default use `_all` field.

That said, using `match` query (or `multi_match`) instead of `query_string`
query will probably be faster. And using multi match on a list of fields than
on `_all` field will probably be faster as match queries are optimized and
uses the _best internal query_ depending on the field and the query content
themselves.

I can not tell how much it's faster. But, you can run test easily for your use
case and measure that.
