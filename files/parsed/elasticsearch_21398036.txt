21398036 elasticsearch : Class not found exception

My elastic search is running.

But when I do this :

    
    
    curl -XPUT "http://127.0.0.1:9200/movies/movie/1" -d'
     {
         "title": "The Godfather",
         "director": "Francis Ford Coppola",
         "year": 1972
     }'
    

This error is coming.

{"error":"IndexCreationException[[movies] failed to create index]; nested:
NoClassDefFoundError[Could not initialize class
org.elasticsearch.index.codec.postingsformat.PostingFormats]; ","status":500}

It could happen if you mix jar files and bring other Lucene dependencies then
the ones required or if you only add elasticsearch jar to your Java project.

It's hard to say here as we don't know how you installed elasticsearch and
which version you are using.

Same command works fine for me.
