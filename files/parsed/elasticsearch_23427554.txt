23427554 Not able to contact elasticsearch on 9200

Team,

  1. I have installed elastic search service and prerequisites on a local machine. I could see that "service elasticsearch status" shows that service is running. 

  2. Below logs are dumped to /var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log file when service is launched. Ip table service is stopped. 

  3. I explicitly un commented network.host and port fields to bind to specified ip and port( 9200), but when i try to contact the machine using  `http://address:9200`, nothing shows up, but the webserver is running on this machine and other sites are accessible. Any thoughts? 

Log:

Thanks!  Santhosh

In your log you have an ip so you don't run it on localhost.  Check the
firewall and actually that the port 9200 is accessible to you.

If you ssh and port forward into that server/computer can you access
elasticsearch? If you cannot access it locally on that server, then it should
something other than the port.

Give us some more details about your systems/servers to help you.

I got the issue fixed, its the elasticsearch.yml file configuration which has
the issue, the ip address was set to the natted ipaddress and its working.

One more Question: Iam using python elasticsearch package, here iam doing an
index using es.index() and wanted to search for few records post the index,
using its search() function, any specific examples of how to use search
function for getting records between two dates for all files which are
indexed?

Had the same issue, confirm your firewall is not blocking the port, You can
also disable the firewall to confirm if thats the issue

    
    
    sudo ufw disable
    curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9200'
