16788697 configuring elastic search index

I was exploring the documentation and Q&A regarding on how to configure an
index in ES. At some point I get really confused. I found two different
versions/ways (?) on how to do it, but I can't seem to find what the
difference is.

(1) this one: [Elasticsearch: Constructing mappings for Java
Client](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12727690/elasticsearch-
constructing-mappings-for-java-client) which seems to be one yml file that
contains all the definitions for the index _bookshelf_ (in the given example)

(2) a definition of a tweet:
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/object-type/> (JSON)

to me, (1) seems to be more conclusive. but anyway, what confuses me is that
(1) has _mappings_ defined, and (2) has _properties_ \- what is the
difference? what is the correct/better way of defining fields for types of an
index?

They're both kinda the same really. 1. Is just being fed to a client which
will eventually just output a JSON file that **looks like** 2\.

The reason 2 looks odd to you is because its documenting/demonstrating a
specific type of mapping, not telling you how to create index mappings.

If you're using an [elasticsearch
client](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/clients/) then consult the
documentation for how they want you to specify mappings, if you want to
interface with elasticsearch using REST commands directly then [read this
documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-indices-
create-index/), (read it anyway to understand how to construct mappings in
general)
