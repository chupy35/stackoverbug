12313319 How to do facet search with mpdreamz Nest

does anybody know how to do facet search with Nest? My index is
<https://gist.github.com/3606852> would like to search for some keyword in
'NumberEvent' and dispaly the result if the keyword exist.Please help me !!!

This is using the assumption that the `MyPoco` class exists and maps to your
elasticsearch document. If it doesn't you can use `dynamic` but you'l have to
swap the lambda based field selectors with strings.

    
    
    var result = client.Search<MyPoco>(s=>s
        .From(0)
        .Size(10)
        .Filter(ff=>ff.
            .Term(f=>f.Categories.Types.Events.First().NumberEvent.event, "keyword")
        )
        .FacetTerm(q=>q.OnField(f=>f.Categories.Types.Facets.First().Person.First().entity))
    );
    

`result.Documents` now holds your documents

`result.Facet<TermFacet>(f =>
f.Categories.Types.Facets.First().Person.First().entity);` now holds your
facets

Your document seems a bit strange though in the sense that it already has
Facets with counts in them.
