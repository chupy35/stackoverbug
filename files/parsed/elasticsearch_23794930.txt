23794930 Elasticsearch Return Only Geometry (location) field

Does anyone know if it is possible in ElasticSearch to return only the
location field?

I have a need to perform a query and only return the geometries associated
with each document; I dont need the rest of the attributes.

I've tried the "fields", but that does not return the location field.

"fields" : ["location"]
