17037838 Which subquery matched out of my compound query?

I have a nested query like this

    
    
    {  
    "fields" : ["title","wordCount"],
    "query":{
        "bool":{
    
                "should":[
            {
                "match":{
                    "title":{
                        "query": searchTerm,
                        "operator": "and"    
                    }
                }
            },
                    {
                        "match_phrase" :{
    
                            "postHtml":{
    
                            "query" : searchTerm,
                            "slop" : 1    
                         }
    
                        }        
                    },
                    {
                        "match":{
                            "caption" : searchTerm
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    

Is there a way know if there is a match on caption or postHtml?

You can wrap each query into a [named
filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/named-
filters/); elasticsearch will give you back the name of the filters that
matched.

Have a look at [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15198481/633239) example.
