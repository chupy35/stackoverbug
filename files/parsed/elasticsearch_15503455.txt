15503455 ElasticSearch: Allow only local requests

How can allow only local requests for elasticsearch?  So command like:

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_settings'
    

can only be running on localhost and request like:

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://mydomain.com:9200/twitter/_settings'
    

would get rejected?

Because, from what i see, elasticsearch allows it by default.

**EDIT:**

According to
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/modules/network.html> you can
manage `bind_host` parameter to allow hosts. And by default, it is set to
`anyLocalAddress`

If your final goal is to deny any requests from outside the host machine, the
most reliable way would be to modify the host's
[iptables](http://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) so that it denies any incoming
requests to the service ports used by ElasticSearch (9200-9300).

If the end goal is to make sure that everyone refers to the service using an
exclusive DNS, you're better off achieving this with an HTTP server that can
proxy requests such as HTTPd or nginx.

For elasticsearch prior to v2.0.0, if you want both http transport and
internal elasticsearch transport to listen only on localhost simply add the
following line to `elasticsearch.yml` file.

    
    
    network.host: "127.0.0.1"
    

If you want only http transport to listen on localhost add the following line
instead.

    
    
    http.host: "127.0.0.1"
    

Starting from v2.0 elasticsearch is listening only on localhost by default.
So, no additional configuration is needed.

I use this parameter:

http.host: "127.0.0.1"

This parameter not accept http requests for external request.
