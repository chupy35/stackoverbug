26125233 Spring boot workflow submodule activiti permissions issue

I am trying to download the sample and play with it. This is exactly what I
was trying to do for one of my clients.

However I am not able to run the sample app. I get error when I try to update
the submodule

git submodule update Cloning into 'activiti'... Warning: Permanently added the
RSA host key for IP address '*' to the list of known hosts. Permission denied
(publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
Clone of 'git@github.com:jbarrez/Activiti.git' into submodule path 'activiti'
failed

Nevermind its a git permissions issues

config change from git@ to https worked.
