18902877 How to use an Array mapping in ES?

I wanted to create a mapping for `movies` that look like:

    
    
    {
       title: "The Artist",
       genres: ["Drama", "Comedy"]
    }
    

In the [ElasticSearch
documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/mapping-
array-type.html) I see this example:

    
    
    "properties" : {
            "message" : {"type" : "string"},
            "tags" : {"type" : "string", "index_name" : "tag"},
            ...
      }
    

However, now I am confused.. What I expected to see was:

    
    
     "properties" : {
         "message" : {"type" : "string"},
          "tags" : {"type" : "array"}
      }
    

So, why does the example just provide a reference to another index? How would
I define that "tags" index? Or, when would I use that Array mapping?

So ElasticSearch doesn't need to specify that a mapping is an array. You can
treat any mapping as an array by using square brackets:

    
    
    {
        title: ["The Artist", "Formerly known as Prince" ],
        genres: ["Drama", "Comedy"],
        ...
    }
    

See the last sentence on the page:

> We could, of course, name the field as tag and skip the index_name all
together

The "index_name" mapping just allows you to define an alias in the plural form
of tag -> tags.
