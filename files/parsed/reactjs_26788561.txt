26788561 User-defined vs. native ReactJS components

Is there a good way to tell if a child is a user-defined ReactJS component or
an "html" component (React.DOM.div, React.DOM.p, etc.)?

In React 0.12 you check if the "type" property is a string. In older versions
you would have to inspect the "constructor" property (`child.constructor.name`
would be a good hint)

    
    
    var Element = <p>Some Tag</p>;
    if (_.isString(Element.type)) console.log("got DOM primitive")
