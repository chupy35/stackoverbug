16076058 Exclude some characters from asciifolding conversion

I have setup a analyzer with asciifolding filter.

This filter replaces the letter ç=>c and ñ=>n. I need to keep the original ç
and ñ in the token.

Is there a way to setup a exception in the asciifolding filter? If not, I can
use a char_filter to do what asciifolding filter do for accents and not for ç
and ñ or there is a better approach?

I didn't find any configuration for exceptions in asciifolding, so I have
setup a char_filter with the mappings I need and apply in my analyzer (without
asciifolding):

char_filter: { my_map: { type: "mapping", mappings: [ "á" => "a", "à" => "a"
.... ] } }
