28671492 How to access an element that's a child of owned component and
doesn't have a ref="..." attribute

Example:

    
    
    var Top = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <A>
            <B>child</B>
          </A>
        );
      }
    });
    

Is there a way to access all `Top`'s child components that don't have a `ref`
attribute (e.g. `B`) and loop over them?
