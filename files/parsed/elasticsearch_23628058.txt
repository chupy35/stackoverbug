23628058 elasticsearch snapshot fails when nodes in a cluster run in different
machines

we are using elasticsearch 1.1.1 We have a cluster with 3 nodes and all three
nodes are in 3 different machines. Accessing the cluster, performing index
operations work fine. But when we use snapshot feature to take the backup, it
(backup) getting failed. but if we have all three nodes on the same machine,
the snapshot command works fine. Did anybody face this issue. I did not
include the configuration details here, as the cluster and indexing operations
work fine without any issues.

Thanks in advance.

For those who are looking for a solution, it is a requirement that we should
use the NFS
