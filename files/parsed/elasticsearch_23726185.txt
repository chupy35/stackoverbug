23726185 Can elasticsearch handle structured data whats its limits?

I have got 5 million objects.Each object has 100 properties. 50 properties
text, 40 properties numeric values and ten properties datetime. I am sending
random ad hoc queries with sorts and all kinds of queries. What ES limits? How
big can the cluster go ?

I would look at the limitations of Apache Lucene rather than Elasticsearch
seeing as ES is essentially Lucene in a big wrapper. You can start by having a
look
[here](http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/lucene40/package-
summary.html#Limitations). Hope this helps.

I don't think you'll get a precise answer as to how big ES can go - as always
it's a question of what kind of documents you are indexing, the complexity of
the queries, the frequency with which you update and query, what acceptable
response times are, etc.

That said, from my own experience of several live clusters with hundreds of
millions of documents each I'd say you are well below any known limits to ES.
I'd also check their list of cases studies, should give you more insight into
how others are using ES.
