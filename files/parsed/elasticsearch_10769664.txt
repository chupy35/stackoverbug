10769664 Elasticsearch flexible search

Does anyone have experience with Elasticsearch and getting the searches to be
more flexible?

Currently, if I have a query "House" it will return the correct items back.
but if "Hous" is typed in, nothing gets returned. Also, if I search "O.J." it
will return O.J. but if I wanted to search OJ I get nothing.
