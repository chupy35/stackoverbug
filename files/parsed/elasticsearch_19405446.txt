19405446 How to boost integer terms within Elasticsearch query

I am trying to find a query for my data, that boosts all the numeric terms
included.

For example:

    
    
    A query on a field "description" contains these terms: 
    "PatientA Disease II 12 A 7 Cell 348 go"
    

I am trying to get items from Elasticsearch whose "description" field contains
similar terms to the above. Similar means especially similar with regard to
the integer values contained in the search query. Additionally, all
punctuation that is contained in the searched data should be ignored.

Desired results:

    
    
    PatientA Cell Disease II 12 A 7 348 go
    PatientB Disease II 12 A 7 Nucleus 348 go
    PatientC, OK, II, 12 A, 7 Cell, 348 go
    PatientD 7 Disease II 12-A Cell 348-go
    

The queries that I tried, always weigh every term the same and get distracted
by punctuation. I found this post, that talks about boosting certain fields.
[Elasticsearch "More Like This" API vs. more_like_this
query](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15300650/elasticsearch-more-like-
this-api-vs-more-like-this-query)

However, how can I boost certain terms in a specific field? Thanks!

i think that you can boost specific keywords by appending something like
`some_keyword^10`.

while i find some references in my code, i have no clue where to look for
documentation...
