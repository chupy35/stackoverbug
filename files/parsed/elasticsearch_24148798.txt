24148798 How to update a nested type in Elastic Search?

Imagine I have a document that contains a question and as a nested type all
answers are added. See example below.

I have the following questions:

How would I update one of the answers ? I know there is the update api, but I
cannot find a way to find for example the answer with id 88 and then change
the text of this answer.

    
    
    {
       "_index": "customer",
       "_type": "question",
       "_id": "8",
       "_score": 1,
       "_source": {
          "id": 8,
          "title": "Question title",  
          "content": "The question text itself",              
          "answers": [
             {
                "answer_id": 42,                     
                "text": "Answer text 1"
             },
             {
                "answer_id": 88,                    
                "text": "Answer text 2"
             },
             {
                "answer_id": 79,                     
                "text": "Answer text 3"
             },
             {
                "answer_id": 80,                    
                "text": "Answer text 4"
             },
             {
                "answer_id": 8,                      
                "text": "Answer text 5"
             }
          ]
       }
    }
