15849127 what does index.store.fs do

I was under the impression that to use the mmapfs store, all I needed to do
was set index.store.type to mmapfs, but I was reading this article and saw
that the author did this

    
    
    index: 
       store: 
         type: mmapfs 
         fs: 
           mmapfs: 
             enabled: true
    

so he basically did what I did then set index.store.fs.mmapfs.enabled to true

My question is what does this the whole index.store.fs section do and where
can I find some documentation on it?

The only config you need is:

    
    
    index.store.type: mmapfs
    

I don't know where the rest of that config was taken from - maybe it is from
an older version.

The best place to see config settings to be sure of what is actually supported
is in the code itself:

While on the subject of mmapfs, it is worth reading this blog entry:
