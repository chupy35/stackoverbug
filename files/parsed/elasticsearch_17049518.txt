17049518 defining the a path for the _parent field

Can I use a "path" for the _parent field?

It is mentioned that the _routing field can do that at:
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/routing-field/>

But at <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/parent-field/>
it's not.

It is not possible. Refer to the issue
<https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3405>
