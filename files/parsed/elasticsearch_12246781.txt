12246781 display limited words from ES field

I am using Mpdreamz/NEST for integrating Elasticsearch in C# . Is there any
way to limit the number of words in a result string of query??

For example I have a field named 'Content' in ES and I need to dispaly 30
words of 'Content' matching 'sensex' from my index.

Thanks in advance for any help

You can't so easily even within Elasticsearch itself.

You have three options

  1. Force excerpts by using highlighting 
  2. Try to use script_fields to return the first 30 words
  3. At index time add another field that has just the first 30 words

Eventhough the first two are possible to do with NEST i would go for the third
option since it won't incur a performance penalty at query time.
