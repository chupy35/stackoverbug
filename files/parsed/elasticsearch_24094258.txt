24094258 Elastic search not_analyzed fields

I have a loginid field in my elastic search Database which contain user email
ids. I want to write a search query to list all occurrence of a particular
mail client (eg gmail.com, yahoo.com etc).

I have managed to write a search query with exact match of an email id

    
    
    {
       "query": {
          "match": {
             "loginid": "dibeesh@amt.in"
          }
       }
    }
    

By executing above query i will get an exact match. My requirement is to match
all email ids ends with '@amt.in'.  loginid is a non_analyzed field in my
elastic search db ie

    
    
    "loginid": {
      "type": "string",
       "index": "not_analyzed"
    }
    

**I have also tried parse_prefix query**

    
    
    {
       "query": {
          "match": {
             "loginid": {
                "query": "dibeesh@amt.in",
                "type": "phrase_prefix"
             }
          }
       }
    }
    

But no luck to get my desired result. Please help me to find a solution. Thank
you

    
    
    {
        "regexp":{
            "loginid": "*@amt.in"
        }
    }
    

use the elastic search regular expression query to achieve this.
