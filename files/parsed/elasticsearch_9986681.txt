9986681 How to implement the statistical facet together with the histogram
facet or the date histogram facet in ElasticSearch?

In this documentation regarding [statistical facet in
ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/facets/statistical-
facet.html), at the bottom of the page, it seems to imply that we can
implement the histogram facet but it does not teach us how.

Could anyone tell me how do you implement statistical facet along with the
histogram facet and the date histogram facet with examples?

The reference to the histogram facet at the bottom of the statistical facet
page seems to be just a copy and paste error. It should read "In order to
implement the _statistical_ facet,..."

Examples of histogram and date histogram facets can be found here:
