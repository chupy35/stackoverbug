25042927 Why are queries not being logged?

I've got an enviroment set on Dev that should keep a log with every query ran,
but it's not writing anything. I'm using the slow-log feature for it...

These are my thresholds on the elasticsearch.yml:

And this is my whole logging.yml:

I'm using ElasticSearch 1.3.1 in this enviroment.

You should set the threshold to 0ms if you want to log all queries. On a
smaller index I was testing on, lots of queries were taking less than 1ms.

If that doesn't work, perhaps elasticsearch isn't using the config file you
are updating.
