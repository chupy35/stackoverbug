17735011 Elasticsearch timeout problems

I've just started indexing pdf/word documents and some of them can get rather
big. To make things worse, I'm using n-grams in my index analyzer. I have 8GB
of RAM dedicated to ElasticSearch but our index is presently about 45GB big
(was only about 6GB without documents) Which leads me to my problem ...

After we added documents to our index, reindexing everything started taking
much longer, which is to be expected, but it also started failing randomly
with a generic timeout error. I traced the problem to our http client
(HTTParty ruby gem) which had a default timeout of 10s. I increased it to 480s
and the reindex gets to more documents but still times out eventually.

My question is,

  1. should Elasticsearch take that long to respond to an index request?
  2. What can I do to fix the problem?
