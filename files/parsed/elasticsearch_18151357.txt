18151357 Give different Boost to queries under an OR condition filter

Is there a way to give a different boost to queries in an OR condition
filter??? I will want to see the results that match with the first query over
the ones that match the second query.

This is part of my query:

    
    
     {
                   "or": [
                                {
                                    "query": {
                                        "query_string": {
                                            "query": "(field_state:ALL OR field_state:'WA') AND type:incentive"
                                        }
                                    }
                                },
                                {
                                    "query": {
                                        "query_string": {
                                            "query": "* AND NOT (type:adcampaign OR type:incentive OR type:page_simple OR type:page OR type:glossary_item OR type:product OR type:lighting_option)"
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                            ]
                        }
    

Based on the ES docs here
(<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/query-string-
query/>), yes you can. `boost` is a listed option for the `query_string` query
type.

While untested, I imagine something like this will do the trick:

    
    
    {
        "or": [
            {
                "query": {
                    "query_string": {
                        "query": "(field_state:ALL OR field_state:'WA') AND type:incentive",
                        "boost": 10.5
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "query": {
                    "query_string": {
                        "query": "* AND NOT (type:adcampaign OR type:incentive OR type:page_simple OR type:page OR type:glossary_item OR type:product OR type:lighting_option)"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
