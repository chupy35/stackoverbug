25067615 Getting the count for several document properties by grouping similar
values

I'm trying to build a set of filters in a UI for an es object. I'd like to
aggregate all the documents and group certain property's by value and get a
count for each.

For example I'd like to be able to build a list of available filters like:

State :

  * TX (5)
  * NJ (1)
  * CA (10) 

Source :

  * Location1 (30) 
  * Location2 (25)
  * Location3 (22)

Where "State" and "Source" are different properties of the document type and
the counts are in parenthesis obviously. I understand an Aggregation request
would be what I want, I'm just looking for a little guidance. Ideally I'd like
to do this with one request and not multiple requests for each property I need
a group by count on.

So, If I am correct then, you just want count of 'state' for each state, and
same case for source.

here is a request for that,

    
    
    POST _/_search
    {
        "size": 0,
        "aggs":{
            "state":{
                "terms":{
                    "field" :"state"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

Does that helps??
