18221430 ElasticSearch parent/child on different indexes

have two objects: humans and belongings. I want to specify a _parent of a
belonging to be a specific human. ElasticSearch provides this ability via the
_parent mapping. However the documentation and most examples I've found are
all doing this from within the SAME index.

But if I had a humans index, and a belongings index, I'm wondering if I am
able to specify the parent relationship across indexes. Preliminary tests seem
to point to NO.

Furthermore, my theory is that you cannot do this because it would result in
the human always being on a different shard as the belonging (different
indexes, different shards). We know from the documentation that the human id
is used to route the child (upon indexing) to the same shard as the human.
This is for efficiency purposes (in memory joins, round trips, etc). But that
cannot occur since we're talking about different shards altogether.

QUESTION #1: Does anyone know if _parent can be specified across indexes?

And if so,

QUESTION #2: How is the routing issues I mentioned resolved internally?

You are correct in saying "different index, different shard" - meaning the
answer to question #1 is no. With that, #2 cannot be answered.
