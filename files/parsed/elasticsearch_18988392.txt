18988392 Elasticsearch: Why is my query returning too many results?

I'm querying `http://elasticsearch.myserver.net:9200/my_index/foo/` with the
following query:

    
    
    {
    "query": {
        "ids": {
          "type": "foo",
          "values": [
            "fff",
            "bar",
            "baz"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

But I'm getting a response with 12 hits, which is the total number of items of
type foo in my index, rather than three, which is the number I requested. I'm
making this query by typing it into the "any request" tab of elasticsearch
head. What is going on?

Update:

I've also tried

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "ids": {
                "type": "programme",
                "values": [
                  "fff",
                  "330930",
                  "200005"
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

with the same result.

If using the Any Request tab in head, make sure you have the dropdown request
method set to "POST". If you have the "GET" method selected it may return all
results similar to what you are seeing.
