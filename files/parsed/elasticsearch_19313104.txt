19313104 Keeping tokens that shorter than minLength in ngram filter
(ElasticSearch)

Is there anyway to keep the tokens that shorter than minLength of ngram in
ElasticSearch?

For example: The data is "abc x" ==> ngram(2,4) will generate tokens: ab, bc,
abc.  "x" was removed because its length < 2 (minLength).

I want to keep "x" because it still a keyword in original data.

What filters I need to use in order to keep it (using ES 0.90) ?

Is it good if ngram filter have an option to keep shorter tokens like in this
case?
