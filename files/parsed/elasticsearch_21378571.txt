21378571 Elasticsearch index not opening due to settings

While trying some new settings, I did PUT a wrong setting on an index.

The index was closed at that time (as required by ES while PUT-ting in new
settings ).  Now when I try to re-open it, it throws "IndexCreationException"
due to those wrong settings.

Even if I try to PUT in a new setting (which I suppose is correct), ES cries
about the previous old wrong settings again throwing "IndexCreationException".

So I am unable to remove or update those wrong settings and my index is not
opening up now.

My question is, do I have any options other than deleting the whole index and
reindexing with corrected settings?

**Update**

[Here is the log](http://hastebin.com/gumujulodi.vhdl) containing the errors.
