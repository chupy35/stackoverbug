11348851 AngularJS: What is the equivalent to Ember.js' CollectionView?

I'm currently evaluating a few JavaScript frameworks and right now I'm working
with AngularJS. I was wondering how I would go about accomplishing the
equivalent to Ember.js' CollectionView in AngularJS? I can't seem to find what
I'm looking for and I just need to be pointed in the right direction.

I'm not sure but I think what you want is [ng-
repeat](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive%3angRepeat)
