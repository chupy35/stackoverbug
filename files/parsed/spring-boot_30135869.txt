30135869 Clear /trace Spring Boot actuator endpoint

Is it possible to clear out the contents of the `/trace` actuator endpoint in
Spring Boot? It would be much easier to debug without wading through a ton of
previous calls.

Out of the box, Spring Boot uses an instance of `InMemoryTraceRepository` to
store all of the trace events. This `TraceRepository` implementation doesn't
provide a mechanism to clear all of its events, but does limit the number of
events to, by default, 100.

You can replace `InMemoryTraceRepository` with your own `@Bean` that
implements `TraceRepository`. You're then free to implement any mechanism of
your choosing to clear out the repository. One obvious way to do this would be
to sub-class `InMemoryTraceRepository`, however its design doesn't lend itself
to subclassing at the moment. If you'd like this to change, or if you'd like
Spring Boot to provide its own mechanism for clearing the repository, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/new).
