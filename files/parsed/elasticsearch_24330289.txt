24330289 Does Elasticsearch stream results?

Does Elasticsearch stream the query results as they are "calculated" or does
it calculate everything and then return the final response back to the client?

By default elasticsearch will only return a limited set of results for a
query. (i.e. searching for * will only return the default count set regardless
of the number of matches).

Generally to implement "streaming" , you make an initial search to get total
count of matching documents and then ask for documents in ranges ( i.e. first
10, next 10, etc.. )

See

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
request-from-size.html>

for how to request the number of documents returned.

Answer to the question in the comments:

> So question would this be the right way to export large results for a
"report" type system? I'm not talking about frond end? I'm talking about a
back end application that will execute a custom query and build a file with
300000 + result

I'm sure there might be a valid reasons for doing this, but to me it sounds
like you're using a hammer to drive screws. Much of the point of using
elasticsearch is to use it's aggregations features to do more of the computing
in the data store.

[Aggregations
Documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
aggregations.html "Aggregations Documentation")

If you really need the raw data of 300000 records, then thats what you need.
However, if it's a report, that implies you're doing some manipulation of the
data into metrics. Much of the point of ES is that it allows you to build
"custom reports" on the fly. I suspect it will be much faster to put as much
logic as you can into the query, rather simply manipulating the raw data.

Without knowing more about the requirements, I can't come up with any better
answer than that.

Have you tried scroll query?

<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
request-scroll.html> much easier to deal with than pagination.

> Scrolling is not intended for real time user requests, but rather for
processing large amounts of data, e.g. in order to reindex the contents of one
index into a new index with a different configuration.
