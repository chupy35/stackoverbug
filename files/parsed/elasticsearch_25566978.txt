25566978 No search hits after moving Elasticsearch index

I need to move an Elasticsearch index from a remote host to my local host. A
bit of research had me find a tool called
[elasticdump](https://github.com/taskrabbit/elasticsearch-dump) which seemed
to be the right one for the job. As specified on its GitHub page, I ran the
following command:

    
    
    elasticdump --input=http://remote_host/index_name --ouput=http://localhost/index_name
    

After running it, the local index indeed contains the documents from the
remote one. But when I pose a query to the local Elasticsearch's search API, I
get no results while the same query returns several hits when posed to the
remote Elasticsearch's API.

What is necessary to make the local search API work?

There's now a mapping import/export flag you can use with elasticdump, which
may be the issue:

  * `elasticdump --input=http://production.es.com:9200/my_index --output=http://staging.es.com:9200/my_index --type=mapping`
  * `elasticdump --input=http://production.es.com:9200/my_index --output=http://staging.es.com:9200/my_index --type=data`
