21651545 ElasticSearch don't penalise verbose content

We're using ElasticSearch to return recipes from our database.

Our problem is that ElasticSearch penalises verbose content:

For a search term like "Chicken Pasta", the ranking would come out as:  1\.
"Chicken Pasta" 2\. "Tasty Chicken Pasta"

Further, 1\. "Horrible Chicken Pasta" 2\. "Very Tasty Chicken Pasta"

For our domain, within certain parts of recipes, we don't want to penalise
verbose content. I.e. many ingredients should be, within certain constraints,
just as good as just a few ingredients.

I'd really appreciate some advice on how we could solve this issue.

You can use custom scoring functions to calculate the score of the results
yourself. Here is a great webcast explaining custom scoring functions:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/videos/introducing-custom-scoring-functions/>

The query that you have to use is the:

    
    
    function_score
    

query to provide your own scoring. You'll find the most important information
about the function_score query in the following document:
