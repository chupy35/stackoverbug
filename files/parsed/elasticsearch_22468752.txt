22468752 parent/child mapping for nested categories

I am trying to create child/parent mapping with nested categories, but smohow
result is confusing

Firstly I created an index

    
    
    PUT /categories/ {}
    

Then mappings

    
    
    /categories/category/_mappings
    {
    
      "_parent": {"type": "category"}
     }
    

indexes

    
    
    PUT /categories/category/1?parent=0
    {
       "name": "Grandparent"
    
    },
    PUT /categories/category/2?parent=0
    {
       "name": "Grandmother"
    
    }
    
    PUT /categories/category/3?parent=1
    {
       "name": "father"
    
    },
    PUT /categories/category/4?parent=1
    {
       "name": "mother"
    
    }
    

I would then expect that flowing search would return me "Grandparent"
category, but it returns me zero hits

    
    
    GET /categories/category/_search
    {
    "query": {
       "has_child": {
          "type": "category",
          "query" : {
            "filtered": {
              "query": { "match_all": {}}
    
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
