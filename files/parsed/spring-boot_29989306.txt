29989306 How to override the managed version of dependencies in Spring Boot

Spring Boot allows us to change the Java version using:

    
    
    <properties>
        <java.version>1.8</java.version>
    </properties>
    

Is there any property to change the Java EE version or spring version in my
Spring Boot `pom.xml`?

Currently I override the managed version using:

    
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
        <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.1</version>
    </dependency>
    

Is there a better way to do this, like just setting properties?

Spring Boot 1.2.3 gives you Spring 4.1.6 by default. How can I force Spring
Boot to give me 4.1.5 instead, just by setting properties?

This in your `pom.xml` should do it:

    
    
    <properties>
        <spring.version>4.1.5.RELEASE</spring.version>
    </properties>
    

All straight from the [docs](http://docs.spring.io/spring-
boot/docs/1.2.3.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-customize-dependency-
versions-with-maven).

Before you go overboard overriding versions of dependencies, heed this advise
(from the link above):

> Each Spring Boot release is designed and tested against a specific set of
third-party dependencies. Overriding versions may cause compatibility issues.
