13466132 Elasticsearch: Is there a function like mongodb findOne

When I search in Mongodb with same query term by findOne / find, findOne is
much faster than find.

In my search case, I just need know if it is exists, So I want search engine
pick one and return, and run my search query fast.

And when I search anything in ElasticSearch, I can always get total of
searching results, It's not very slow but not fast as I expected.

FYI, My elasticsearch store about 2 million documents, and some search terms
hint over 200 thousands documents, which may take over 500 ms.

I'm looking for a function like Mongodb's findOne, which can slow my query
time to less than 100 ms.

Or is there any other solutions ?

Thanks.

Try either count api:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/count.html>

Or search_type=count:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/search-type.html>

Either should be more efficient if you don't need any hit data, though they do
still calculate total document count.
