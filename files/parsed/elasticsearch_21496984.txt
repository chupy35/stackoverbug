21496984 Trouble installing elasticsearch

while doing $sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-0.90.10.deb

it gives the following error :

Processing triggers for man-db ... Setting up elasticsearch (0.90.10) ...
chown: cannot access `/etc/elasticsearch/*': No such file or directory dpkg:
error processing elasticsearch (--install): subprocess installed post-
installation script returned error exit status 1 Processing triggers for
ureadahead ... Errors were encountered while processing: elasticsearch

directory /etc/elasticsearch exists and I am not able to gather proper reason
for it.

the call in the installation script, which seems to fail, is actually

` chown -Rh root:root /etc/elasticsearch/* `

which is extremely strange. The only thing I can imagine right now, is that
you were not having proper privileges (can you show the permissions of
`/etc/elasticsearch` \- do you have any subdirectories inside it? If so, are
those allowed to be accessed (is the executable flag set)? The output of `find
/etc/elasticsearch -ls` might be interesting

Does this also happen with newer versions of the debian package (0.90.11 or
1.0.0)? Also, which distribution are you using?

I didn't have any files in /etc/elasticsearch didn't have any files in it and
thus caused an error. Just put a file in the directory and it will do the
update or install file;

    
    
    sudo touch /etc/elasticsearch/tmp
