22646041 Return Child Properties In ElasticSearch Query

I have had to refactor some of my code in my app to use a Child/Parent
relationship in ElasticSearch. I use the Parent as the main search object, and
use HasChild to filter on any child properties.

As it stands now, the return object is the complete parent object. But in my
code, I also require access to some of the child properties (Namely the child
ID). Is this possible to be returned in the result set?

If you need data from the child, then you're actually looking for a query on
the child object with a `has_parent` clause to filter by some condition on the
parent.

Think of it this way: your results should include one hit per matching child,
even if two children share the same parent. So the primary object you're
searching is actually the child and not the parent.

You could also consider using a [`top-
children`](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-top-children-query.html#query-dsl-top-children-query) query which would
give you parents and their matching children, however this requires some
estimations regarding how many children you expect to see per parent.
