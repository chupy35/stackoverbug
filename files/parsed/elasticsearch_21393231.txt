21393231 Removing/Downgrading to older version of ElasticSearch

I installed ElasticSearch 0.90.10 deb (Using Software Center) without knowing
that I needed to use 0.20.6. I have removed directories pertaining to
0.90/0.20 to start off fresh but when I tar -zxvf elasticsearch-0.20.6 and
curl the localhost I still get that I'm using v.0.90.10 !

I've tried to do some research on how to remove ES 0.90.10 but nothing has
resolved my issue.  Can anyone guide me in the right direction?
