20890448 Push id to ElasticSearch via PIG

Is it possible to push the _id field via ESStorage / PIG towards the ES
cluster? The
[documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/hadoop/current/pig.html)
doesn't state anything related to this subject.

According to this
[post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elasticsearch/jK_MDNyeRgI),
this functionality is in the current development version. Example:

    
    
    B = FOREACH A GENERATE id, name, TOBAG(url, picture) AS links 
    STORE B INTO 'pig/update' USING org.elasticsearch.hadoop.pig.ESStorage('es.mapping.id=id')
