20987215 Substring and similarity matching in elasticsearch

I am learning to use elastisearch as alternative for database queries and I am
not able to perform substring matches on the built index. The mapping I have
used to create index is

    
    
            "mappings" : {
               "user" : {
                 "properties" : {
                    "name" : {"type": "string"},
                    "specialty" : {"type": "string" ,"analyzer":"snowball"},
                    "address : {"type": "string" ,"analyzer":"snowball"}
                  }
               }
              }
    

The document I am indexing is

    
    
        {
          "name" : "John Doe",
          "speciality": ["pediatrician","Child Doctor"],
          "address": ["#123 park road Abbeyville","#423 park road AbbeyTown" ]
         }
    

When I perform a search like

    
    
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/test/user/_search?q=speciality:pediatrician
    

I get the correct document

However when I search strings like

    
    
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/test/user/_search?q=speciality:pedia
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/test/user/_search?q=speciality:pediatricians
    

No results are retrieved

P.S I know that wild cards can be used for matching but I need to be able to
search for both the whole word and parts of the words based on user input so
as to return the most relevant documents.

Did you try reindexing after changing the mapping? Also try setting the search
analyzer to snowball in the settings.

**UPDATE:**

You can go for wild card search. Better go for trailing wild card search alone
instead of both leading and trailing wild card search.

    
    
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/test/user/_search?q=speciality:pedia*
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/test/user/_search?q=speciality:pediatricians*
