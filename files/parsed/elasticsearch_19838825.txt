19838825 What are elasticsearch indices?

They are not mentioned in [ES
glossary](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html).

What is their relationship to other ES entities (shards / nodes / indexes) ?

Indices is the plural of index. If you have more than one index you call them
indices. <http://www.thefreedictionary.com/index>

**Indices** are equivalent to databases in Relational DBMS. Just like
Relational Database has schema, ES **index** has **mapping**.

**Shards** => **index** is broken into shards (in order to distribute them and
scale)

**Replicas** => copies of the **shards** (provide reliability if a node is
lost)

I hope the following diagram(taken from [Rafal Kuc's
slides](http://www.slideshare.net/kucrafal/scaling-massive-elastic-search-
clusters-rafa-ku-sematext?ref=http://prayag-waves.blogspot.com/)) demonstrates
the relationship between ES Cluster, Index, Node and Shards.

Also, there's a nice stackoverflow post [Shards and replicas in
Elasticsearch](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15705989/432903) by
