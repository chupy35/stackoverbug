I have been trying to implement the `"or"` operator in elasticsearch query.  
i have 3 documents with field and value as given below

    
    
    dummyText : birthday party
    
    dummyText : birthday morning one
    
    dummyText : birthday evening two
    

I use the match query as

    
    
    {
       "query": {
            "match": {
              "dummyText": {
                 "operator": "or",
                 "query": "birthday evening"
                 }
               }
           }
    }
    

It returns only one document which matches `"birthday evening"`. why isn't it
returning all the documents which has value "birthday"? Please, guide me on
this.
