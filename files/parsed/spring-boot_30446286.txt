30446286 spring boot dependency not found

I have spring boot application with documentum dependency (dfc.jar). The
application works fine in debug mode (by specifying jvmArguments in spring-
boot-maven-plugin and attaching a debugger through IDE). But the bundled
application throws error when I put it on a different box. Please help.

If you installed _DFC_ then the installer changed the `Classpath` environment
variable. This may be the reason why it works on your first box and not the
second.

If that is the case, then you need to define the `Classpath` in all the places
where your run it.

It really depends on your error

As m4ktub said you need your dfc's (and depending) libraries in the classpath
of the JVM running your application. In case of web application you would
probably bundle this in your webapp's lib folder.

Also you might not referencing your dfc.properties - it should also be in your
VM's classpath.
