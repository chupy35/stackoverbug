25057850 ElasticSearch fields not working

I have the inquisitor plugin to query iis logs, but for some reason when i try
to reduce the number of the returned fields it doesn't work at all.

This query works as expected:

    
    
    {
     "query": {
    
        "term":
    { "geoip.country_name" : "ukraine"}  
    
    } }
    

but when i add fields it does not.

    
    
    {
     "fields" : ["port"],
     "query": {
    
        "term":
    { "geoip.country_name" : "ukraine"}  
    
    }
    }
    

Use _source, instead of fields,

I think 'port' is a nested object, which you cannot get by using 'fields'

so do as,

    
    
    {
            "_source" : ["path"]
    }
    

So, your source, only contains path.
