24483269 How to know the number of types in the elastic search index

Here is my question description

  * I created elastic search index named **testindex**
  * curl -XPUT 'localhost:8080/testindex/type1/id1?pretty=true'
  * As of now i know my testindex has one type i.e type1
  * I have one more index called **anotherindex** ,i want to know how many types in **anotherindex** by seeing index name itself.
  * How to know.Is there any curl command ?

You can use the get mapping command:

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/anotherindex/_mapping?pretty'
    

The command will list all the mappings for index anotherindex.
