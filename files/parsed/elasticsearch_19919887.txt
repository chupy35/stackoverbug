19919887 Elasticsearch Multiple Cluster Search

I just watched [Rafal Kuc's
presentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/videos/scaling-massive-
elasticsearch-clusters/) and would like to use it for the basis of an Elastic
Search Question.

If I added 50 million documents per day to a cluster where each day created a
new index (time based [data design pattern](http://vimeo.com/44716955)),
eventually in time that would get pretty big. For example sake we'll put the
avg document at 15kb.

Now lets say I needed to do that for 10 years. Eventually, I would need to
create multiple clusters. Can I create multiple clusters in ES and search them
all simultaneously? Could I use an alias for something like this? Or is it not
possible?

No, I think a search via the api or your client of choice (Java/Python/etc) is
going to be against a single cluster.

Your client could make multiple requests one to each cluster, perhaps if you
organized your clusters by years?

In theory a cluster could just grow forever, although at some point I would
think the overhead of scattering and gathering a query to N nodes (where N is
very very very large) would cause problems.
