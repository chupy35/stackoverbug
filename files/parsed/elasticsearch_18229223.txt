18229223 Which should be used for searching XGET or XPOST

Which should be used ( **XGET** or **XPOST** ) for quering ElasticSearch.
Whether **XGET** or **XPOST** have faster response for searching. Thanks.

Arguments for GET:

  * A search is conceptually a GET
  * GET requests are typically optimized for caching, although this may be 
  * Some elasticsearch searches can be done as a GET request without requiring a request body

Arguments for POST:

  * It's harder to perform a GET request with a request body because a lot of clients don't support it (including javascript XHR in modern browsers)
  * GET requests are typically optimized for caching even when you don't want it (although there are many ways to prevent it such as adding a query string argument, such as `?time=1376535485`)
  * People just don't expect a GET to have a request body ( see [HTTP GET with request body](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/978061/http-get-with-request-body) )
  * Caching requires an extra layer in front of elasticsearch (such as apache or nginx), although this may be a moot point since having an extra layer allows for gzip compression.

Personally, I prefer POST for simplicity's sake. Elasticsearch is already
blazing fast and there's little need to cache requests beyond what
elasticsearches already does internally unless you're dealing with a very high
usage scenario.
