25042683 Can ElasticSearch create/store just the indexes while leaving the
source document where it is?

Assuming I already have a set of documents living in some document store can I
have ElasticSearch create its indexes and store them in its various replicated
nodes while leaving the documents themselves where they are? In other words
can I use ES just for search and not for storage? (I understand this might not
be ideal but assume there are good reasons I need to keep the documents
themselves where they are).

If I take this approach does it remove any functionality from search, for
example showing where in a document the search term was found?

Thanks.

The link Konstantin referenced should show you how to disable _source.

There is another way to store fields (store=true). You are better off using
_source and excluding any specific fields you don't want stored as part of
_source, though.

Functionality removed:

  * Viewing fields that are returned from search 
  * Highlighting 
  * Easily rebuilding an index from _source. Probably not an issue, since data is stored elsewhere

There are probably other features I am missing.

The only case I've come across where I really don't need _source is when
building an analytics engine where I am only returning aggregates (term and
histogram).
