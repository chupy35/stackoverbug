24920472 How to increase size of string in elastic search

I'm looking how to increase the length of a string in elastic search. This
post, [UTF8 encoding is longer than the max length
32766](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24019868/utf8-encoding-is-longer-
than-the-max-length-32766), says that in order to do that I need to do one of
the following:

    
    
    1) change the type to binary
    2) to continue to use string but set the index type to "no"
    

How would I do either of these?

You will need to change the mapping for the field and then re-index the data -
you cannot change a mapping for a field after you've indexed data into it.

If you are unfamiliar with the concept of mappings within Elasticsearch or the
Put mappings API, I'd start reading here:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/mapping-
intro.html>

and here:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
put-mapping.html>

Assuming you wanted to created a field as binary, you'd do something like
this:

    
    
    $ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/yourindex/yourtype/_mapping' -d '
    {
        "yourtype" : {
            "properties" : {
                "yourbigstring" : {"type" : "binary", "store" : true }
            }
        }
    }
    '
    

and if you want to leave it as a string but not analyzed:

    
    
    $ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/yourindex/yourtype/_mapping' -d '
    {
        "yourtype" : {
            "properties" : {
                "yourbigstring" : {"type" : "string", "store" : true, "index" : "not_analyzed"}
            }
        }
    }
    '
