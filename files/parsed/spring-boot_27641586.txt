27641586 How to customize Spring Boot Actuator endpoints

I'm trying to implement Spring Boot Actuator on a non "Boot Application", is
there a way to configure a pattern to endpoints like
`endpoint/health`,`endpoint/metrics`? Then I'll create a second realm in my
existing Spring Security configuration, I tried the documentation but I could
not find a thing about.

Thanks.

Did you mean `management.contextPath=/endpoint` ([docs
here](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-
SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-customizing-management-server-
context-path))?
