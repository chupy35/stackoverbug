23838467 Similar Entry in Elasticsearch

I posted to:

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/cities/city/1
    
    {
    "zip": "84359",
    "city": "Simbach"
    }
    

Now i wanted to find Simpach which is exactly 2 letters wrong:

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/cities/_search
    
    {
        "query": {
           "fuzzy": {
               "city" : {
                   "value" : "Simpdach",
                   "fuzziness" : 30
               }
    
           }
        }
    

but i dont get any result. I already saw this entry on stackoverflow and i
cant find out, what i am doing wrong:

[Fuzzy string matching using Levenshtein algorithm in
Elasticsearch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21748164/fuzzy-string-
matching-using-levenshtein-algorithm-in-elasticsearch)

Check your mapping and make sure `city` field is analyzed. Something like:

    
    
    PUT /fuzzy_products/product/_mapping
    {
      "product": {
        "properties": {
          "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "analyzer": "simple
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

[Check "simple fuzzy match" section](https://www.found.no/foundation/fuzzy-
search/). I hope it will be helpful.
