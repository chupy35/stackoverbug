23994144 has_parent does not work when parent and cihld index types are same
in ElasticSearch

I would like to design a comment/reply system in `ElasticSearch` using
[parent/child](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
parent-field.html). If I use separate types like `/twitter/tweet` and
`/twitter/reply` both `has_parent` and `has_child` query and filters works.
However, when I store all messages in `/twitter/tweet` and set mapping as
below only `has_child` query works, since `has_parent` does not work I am not
able to reach replies belongs to specific tweet. Is it wrong to create a
`parent/child` relation on same document type of an index?

    
    
    curl -XPOST localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_mapping -d '{
    "tweet":{
     "_parent": {"type": "tweet"}
    }
    }'
