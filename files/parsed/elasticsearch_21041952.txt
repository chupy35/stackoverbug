21041952 Using a combined field as id mapping in ElasticSearch

From this question I can see that it is possible [Use existing field as id in
elasticsearch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16653393/use-existing-
field-as-id-in-elasticsearch)

My question is, if can do similar thing but concatenating fields.

    
    
    {
    "RecordID": "a06b0000004SWbdAAG",
    "SystemModstamp": "01/31/2013T07:46:02.000Z",
    "body": "Test Body"
    }
    

And then do something like

    
    
    {
      "your_mapping" : {
          "_id" : {
              "path" : "RecordID" + "body"
         }
     }
    }
    

So the id is automatically formed from concatenating those fields.

No you can't, you can only make the _id point to a field that's within the
document, using the dot notation as well if needed (e.g. `level1,level2.id`).

I'd suggest to have a field that contains the whole id in your documents, or
even better to take the id out and provide it in the url, as configuring a
path causes the document to be parsed when not needed.
