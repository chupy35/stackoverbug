10202926 How to I make a field sortable in ElasticSearch?

I have tried, for example:

    
    
    {
      "sort": [
        {
          "retail_price": {
            "reverse": true
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    

... to no avail. Do I need to map the field a special way in order to enable
sorting on it?

The field should satisfy two conditions: 1) it has to be indexed and 2) it
shouldn't have more than one value per document or more than one token per
field. If retail_price is indexed in your case and it still doesn't work for
you, could you post a script that demonstrates the problem?
