16813900 ElasticSearch: I want to get count with group by

I have the following type on ElasticSearch: { bundle_id: 11141 bundle_name:
bla_bla country: India }

I want to perform the following query (I'll describe it in SQL):

select count(distinct bundle_id) from my_type where county in('india', 'usa')

Thanks!!

Have a look at [Terms
Aggregation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-bucket-terms-
aggregation). This is what you are looking for.
