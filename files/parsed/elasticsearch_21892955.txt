21892955 Elasticsearch : Query string on field

Can someone tell if I am right/wrong to check if title field contains Item

    
    
    curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/myapp/item/_search" -d'
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": { 
               "query": "title:Item"
            }
        }
    }'
    

EDIT

I have a title like this "Economics and statistics"

**This one returns a record**

    
    
    curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/myapp/item/_search" -d'
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": { 
               "query": "title:*statistics*"
            }
        }
    }'
    

**This one does not return anything**

    
    
    curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/myapp/item/_search" -d'
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": { 
               "query": "title:statistics"
            }
        }
    }'
    

**This one does not return anything either (strange)**

    
    
    curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/myapp/item/_search" -d'
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": { 
               "query": "title:*Economics*"
            }
        }
    }'
    

The doc says :

where the status field **_contains_** active

    
    
    status:active
    

Your query looks good. but you can also achieve same by below query.

    
    
    curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/myapp/item/_search" -d'
    {
       "query": {
          "term": {
             "title": {
                "value": "Item"
             }
          }
       }
    }'
    

While looking into elasticsearch query optimizations stuff I found suggestion
to avoid to use of `query_string` until it is necessary. also `query_string`
is not cached by default.

For beginner like me facing issues with ES : Be really careful on how you map
/ tokenize your data. "not_analyzed" does not mean what I thought it meant and
that lead me to the issue above.

    
    
    you can mention a particular field in default_field
    
    {
        "query_string" : {
            "default_field" : "content",
            "query" : "this AND that OR thus"
        }
    }
    
    if you want to specify more than one field then 
    
    {
        "query_string" : {
            "fields" : ["content", "name"],
            "query" : "this AND that"
        }
    }
    
    
    
    curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/myapp/item/_search" -d'
    {
        "query": {
            "match": { 
               "title": "statistics"
            }
        }
    }'
    

This would be enough if you want to search exact terms(not exact content of
the field). Try to avoid the usage of wildcards as it is expensive. For
searching with a fraction of word in a field, you have to modify the mapping
as of your need.

Check your mapping and see the type of field **title** . If it is
not_analyzed, re-index it to be **analyzed** (by default).
