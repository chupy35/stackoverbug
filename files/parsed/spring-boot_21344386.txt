21344386 Getting application context from a CommandLinerRunner

How can we get access to ApplicationContext from a CommandLineRunner class. Is
there a better newer way than using ApplicationContextAware

Autowiring would work, either as a field

    
    
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext context;
    

or a method

    
    
    @Autowired
    public void context(ApplicationContext context) { this.context = context; }
    

Same as `ApplicationContextAware` really.

It's a smell in any case - maybe if you think about your use case you will
find a way to do it without the context?
