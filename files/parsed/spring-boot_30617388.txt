30617388 What is the best way to @Conditional on the inclusion of the actuator
feature?

I'd like to make some of our auto configurations classes conditional on the
presence of the SpringBoot actuator feature on the classpath.

Against which class should I write my @ConditionalOnClass annotation? Possible
candidates are:

  * `org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.EndpointAutoConfiguration`
  * `org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.EndPoint`

It doesn't matter, which one you choose, as long as it is packaged in the
actuator JAR (which is the case for both of the classes you mentioned).
