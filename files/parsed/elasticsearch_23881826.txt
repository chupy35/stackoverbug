23881826 Elasticsearch delete after field time

I have an index containing data with the field "expirationDate" which is a
datetime object. I want to set these documents to automatically delete after
that time has passed? Is there anyway to do this, or anyway I can cron this
within elasticsearch to automatically run once an hour?

You need to enable TTL for your index (see
[documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
ttl-field.html#_enabled_2)) and then add `_ttl` field to documents containing
number of milliseconds till `expirationDate`.

Of course, you need to remember to update `_ttl` field whenever
`expirationDate` changes.

The only way (I can think of) to set the document to expire on specific time
is definitely hacky. You could configure
[`_timestamp`](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
timestamp-field.html) path to point to your `expirationDate` field and set
`_ttl` to 1 millisecond. It could work, but for me it sounds a little bit like
a 'feature abuse'.
