17832058 I am looking for storing particular field in particular shard in
elasticsearch

By routing we can allocate particular file/doc/json in particular shard which
make it easy to extract data. But I am thinking as would it be possible to
store particular field of json file in particular shard. for eg: i had three
field : username , message and time. I had created 3 shard for indexing. Now i
want that username is stored in one shard , message in another shard and time
in another shard.

Thanks

No this is not possible. The whole document (the JSON doc) will be stored on
one shard. If you want to do what you describe, then you should split the data
up into separate docs and then you can route them differently.

As for the reasoning, imagine there was a username query which matched
document5. If document5 was spread over many shards, these would all have to
be queried to get the other parts of document5 back to compile the results.
Imagine further a complex AND query across different fields, there would be a
lot of traffic (and waiting) to find out if both fields match to compute if
the document was a hit or not.
