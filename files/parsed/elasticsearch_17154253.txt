17154253 How to search for "OR" word inside a Field on ElasticSearch?

IÂ´m having a problem when I try to search into a field that stores the states
acronyms.

I have the next query:

    
    
    {
        "query": {
             "query_string": {
                   "query": "field_state:'OR' AND type:incentive"
                     }
                  }
    } 
    

And the problem comes when i try to get the results for the Oregon State (OR).
For all the other states works but with this particular one is like the
Elasticsearch takes the "OR" as a condition an retrieves all.

Is there a way to make this work????, i have try it with terms, prefix
filters, and all with the same results.

It sounds like you want to change the default analyzer away from the [Standard
Analyzer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-
modules/analysis/standard-analyzer/) (which does a bunch of stuff including
filtering out english stop words like "or"). Here's an example using the
[Simple Analyzer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-
modules/analysis/simple-analyzer/) (which only lowercases):

    
    
    curl -XPOST "http://MYHOST/MYINDEX/_close"
    curl -XPUT "http://MYHOST/MYINDEX/_settings" -d '{
      "analysis": {
        "analyzer": {
          "default": {
            "type": "simple"
          }
        }
      }
    }'
    curl -XPOST "http://MYHOST/MYINDEX/_open"
    

However if you **only** want to change the analyzer for `field_state`, you can
update the mapping for that field directly:

    
    
    curl -XPUT "http://MYHOST/MYINDEX/MYTYPE/_mapping" -d '{
      "MYTYPE": {
        "properties": {
          "field_state": {
            "analyzer": "simple",
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }'
    

Just note that if you're using the simple analyzer, you may have to search for
"or" instead of "OR":

    
    
    curl -XPOST "http://MYHOST/MYINDEX/MYTYPE/_search" -d '{
      "query": {
        "query_string": {
          "query": "field_state:'or' AND type:incentive"
        }
      }
    }'
