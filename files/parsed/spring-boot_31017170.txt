31017170 Is there a simple way to enable stack traces in Spring Boot logging?

I want to see more than just the Exception's message string in my logs -- a
full stack trace would be preferable. Is there an easy way to do this, or do I
have to delve into Logback custom classes? I'd rather just set a config option
somewhere.

You have to add the exception to the pattern for Logback. According to the
[logback documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html) you can
either add `%ex` or `%xEx`. If you haven't configured a custom logback
configuration so far, exceptions should already be logged because the default
logback configuration which comes with Spring Boot, contains these pattern
keywords. If it doesn't work, there might be another problem.
