22876314 having issues accessing elasticsearch

I'm very new to elasticsearch. Using SSH, I've been able to run it via
bin/elasticsearch and if I run curl localhost:9200, I can see the details and
confirm that it's running. Furthermore, I've installed Marvel and Head, but
I'm not sure how to access these GUIs from a browser.

The documentation says to browse to localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel but
obviously on our live server this will not work. I've tried replacing
localhost with my servers IP but I get nothing. Am I missing something?

In response to Drew R. The latest version is installed and it had been
restarted after the installation via the shutdown api.

Sudo IP Tables did produce a lot of DROP results, but I can't make sense of
that `(This policy will halt a connection to a host without any communication
unless there is a target rule that applies.)`

`curl -vv server:9200/_plugin/marvel` returned:

First of all, double-check you've installed marvel:

    
    
    bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/marvel/latest
    

Then restart ES. Do you see it in the list of plugins in the logs?

If you do, then make sure you aren't blocked from seeing port 9200 outside the
machine (`sudo iptables -L`, for example). If it's AWS, make sure your
security group has it open as well.

If it's none of those, what do you get if you run `curl -vv
server:9200/_plugin/marvel`?
