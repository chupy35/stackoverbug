20420162 ES hostname in response

I have few ES servers in load balancing mode. When I perform query to
host1:9200 then one of host1,host2,host3 can process this query. Is it
possible to get somehow this hostname in ES response?

In other words I'm looking for equivalent of "select myfield, @@servername
FROM table" in MS SQL Server.

Thanks

If you are using the http api you can get the hostname from the `Host` header
in the response.

For example if you make your query with curl and you use the `-v` flag, it
prints the response header where you can find the hostname that sends the
response, in this case localhost:

    
    
    curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/test/_search" -v -d '
    {
      "query": {"match_all":{}}
    }'
    
    * About to connect() to localhost port 9200 (#0)
    *   Trying ::1... connected
    * Connected to localhost (::1) port 9200 (#0)
    > GET /test/_search HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5
    > Host: localhost:9200
    > Accept: */*
    > Content-Length: 32
    > Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    < Content-Length: 875
    <
    

In any case remember that if you have your data split in several shards, more
than one host can be part of the process of the query.
