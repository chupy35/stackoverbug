22846171 Updating _ttl in elasticsearch

As I understood about _ttl in Elasticsearch, we could set _ttl at index level
or (document) type level.

Also, we could change _ttl by changing mapping but it wont affect already
indexed documents but only new docs. I know there is an update API which let
us change the _ttl for a document (and not for all docs in a type).

How should I change the _ttl for all indexed docs in whole index or for all
indexed documents in a type ?
