18770391 if is match on keyword in title, the result is in first order

I am really new in elasticsearch and I would like to ask you, hwo do this. For
example, I have the documents

    
    
    { "title": "car", "description" : "something"}
    { "title": "cat", "description" : "car"}
    

and I need if someone searches for term "car" to have in first order documents
containing this term in title and then other.

Thanks.

You can use a
[multi_match](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/multi-
match-query/) query that queries multiple fields (title and description),
giving a different weight to them.

    
    
    {
        "query" : {
            "multi_match" : {
                "query" : "car",
                "fields" : [ "title^2", "description" ]
            }
        }
    }
