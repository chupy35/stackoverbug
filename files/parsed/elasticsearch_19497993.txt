19497993 return at least one unique value for low-boost fields

Imagine, we have a document {position, primary_language, secondary_language}

Let it contains next data:

    
    
    Junior Software Developer,  python,  ruby
    Senior Software Developer,  ruby,    python
    Python Software Developer,  python,  php
    Ruby Junior Developer,      ruby,    php
    Programmer,                 ruby,    python
    Python Programmer,          python,  php
    .....
    ...and more and more lines
    

And I do multi_match search for 'python' against position, primary_language,
secondary_language with result size=5

What I want:

  * I want at least 1 row, where 'python' contains in the position field
  * I want at least 1 row, where 'python' contains in the primary_language field 
  * I want at least 1 row, where 'python' contains in the secondary_language field

If I play with 'boost', I could get 5 results with python in primary or
secondary, but not in position, also with boosting position I could return 5
results with 'python' in position title, but nothing in primary and secondary.

I generally I'm building something like distinct from sql.

Thanks

UPDATE:

Found that dismax filter works for me, thought it's native behavior quite
different - checking this paper <http://searchhub.org/2010/05/23/whats-a-
dismax/>
