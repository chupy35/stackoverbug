30275976 Spring Boot 1.2.3.RELEASE ApplicationReadyEvent not found

I am reading Spring Boot reference (version 1.2.3-RELEASE) and in point 22.4
Application events and listeners point 4 states:

"An ApplicationReadyEvent is sent after the refresh and any related callbacks
have been processed to indicate the application is ready to service requests."

So I tried:

    
    
    SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(LearnSpringBootApplication.class);
    app.addListeners(new ApplicationListener<ApplicationReadyEvent>() {
    

...

but it cannot find the ApplicationReadyEvent. Has it been removed ? If so - is
there any equivalent for it ?

I found this post here:

[Spring Boot - Wait for web server to
start](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28240403/spring-boot-wait-for-web-
server-to-start)

but was wondering if there is another way?
