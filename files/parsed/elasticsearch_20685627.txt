20685627 How to treat each keyword as a prefix in Elastic Search

I am used to FTS techs doing this for me but imagine I input `mongo fac` into
Elastic Search.

I expect it to be able to find `mongo factory` or `mongodb something` equally,
however, it does not.

Assume I have a single field called `title`. I have three documents with the
`title`s:

  * Mongo Factory
  * Mongodb something
  * cheese

I have a single `boolean` `should` clause with:

    
    
    array('prefix' => array(
        'title' => 'mongo fac'
    )),
    

Using default analyzers, no special configuration, `mongo factory` will be
found but not `mongodb something`.

What I want is for `monogdb something` to appear in the results as well,
basically for Elastic Search to tokenize the keywords; as well as searching
for `mongo fac` it should also search for `mongo` and `fac`.

Except for tokenizing myself what else can I do to get elastic search to work
the way I want to, perferrably using their tokenizer as a means to tokenize my
keywords?

For reference to others who come across this question: I didn't find a valid
solution in the end so I just wrote a function to tokenise the words myself
and form separate prefix queries and it works as it should.
