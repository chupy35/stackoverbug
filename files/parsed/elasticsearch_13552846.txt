13552846 multi_match for _search in elasticsearch is returning all items in my
index

Here's my query:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "multi_match": {
          "use_dis_max": false,
          "query": "xxxinvalidqueryxxx",
          "fields": [
            "Title",
            "IsOriginalContent",
            "TextContent"
          ]
        }
      },
      "filter": {},
      "from": 0,
      "size": 5,
      "sort": [
        {
          "_score": "desc"
        }
      ]
    }
    

However, no matter what query I enter, it returns all items in my index. Why
is this?

Because `IsOriginalContent` is a boolean field. No idea why, but when I remove
it, everything works correctly. It's as if searching a boolean field for text
always returns 'true' with some very low score.

When I remove any boolean fields from the field list, queries work as
expected.
