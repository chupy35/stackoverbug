12929659 Doing search in elasticsearch

I prepare query object and do search in elasticsearch.

For making query object, I give key and their value.

Problem is, when key and value is like "brand":"Men's Wear" then In this case
elasticsearch is unable to give me related docs. I think problem is with comma
or may be space. everything is fine if I use other json property for key and
value (having no space and comma like "priority":"high")

Any help please!

Update:

no match query still not working! one more problem i found in creating search
query. query i am using is:

    
    
    var qryObj1 = {
                           "query" : {
                            "text" : {"name":"Tom"}
                        }
                    };     
    

This will return all docs having name Tom. Now I want to get all docs having
name Tom and profession is developer. So, here modified one:

    
    
    qryObj1 = {
                        "query" : {
                            "text" : {"name":"Tom","profession":"developer"}
                        },"operator" : "and"
    
                    };     
    

but search result is old one. any help!

Sounds like you are using TermQuery, aren't you?

TermQuery are not analyzed so they don't match with your analyzed content.

Try with a [MatchQuery](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-
dsl/match-query.html). It should work.

You need to use boolean query
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/bool-query.html>

Here you can ask ES to take AND or OR of various queries

    
    
    "bool" : {
        "must" : [
                        "text" : {"name":"Tom"},
                        "text" : {"profession":"developer"}
        ]
    

}
