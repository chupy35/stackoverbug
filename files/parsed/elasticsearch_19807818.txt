19807818 ElasticSearch Restricting Index, Field creation for Production

For production I would like to restrict ElasticSearch automatic index
creation. As per the documentation I have restricted the server
_elasticsearch.yml_

    
    
    action.auto_create_index
    index.mapper.dynamic: false
    

However I'm stable to insert new documents with fields that do not match the
custom mapping?

According to
[documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
dynamic-mapping.html), I think `dynamic mapping` should be set to `strict`.

> The dynamic creation of fields within a type can be completely disabled by
setting the dynamic property of the type to strict.
