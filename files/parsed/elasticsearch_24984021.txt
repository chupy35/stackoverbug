24984021 Elasticsearch - startswith filter?

I am trying to get a simple startswith functionality in Elasticsearch. For
example, I want the query "char" to match "charlotte", but I don't want it to
match "dacharlotte". Using an edgeNgram filter gave me the latter result. I
only want it to match results that START with the query terms, not just have
them in them.

The simplest way to do what you want would be to use the prefix query:

    
    
    {
        "query": {
             "prefix":{ "name" : "char" }
         }
    }
