12738689 Re-index an existing ElasticSearch index to updated templates

Is there a way to make an existing index or a set of indices re-index to match
the most recent version of matching templates? By re-index I mean change their
mappings and settings to match what is in the template.

IMHO, you can't do it easily. That said, there's a feature request that can
help in the future but only if you didn't disable _source.

What you can do in the meantime is to use a script to scan and scroll your
index and reindex it in another index.
