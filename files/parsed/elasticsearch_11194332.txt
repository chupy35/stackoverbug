11194332 update non-existing document in elasticsearch

Is it possible to create a new document instead of getting an error when
trying to update a non-existing document in elasticsearch? I know I could
check first but I would love to save that one additional call per document.

Kimchy has implemented upsert(update-insert) in latest release 0.19.5  Please
