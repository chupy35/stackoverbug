18329818 How to Resolve search with Stop words

I am implementing an application using elastic search.

Here is the sample of the search query

    
    
    queryBuilder.must(QueryBuilders.fuzzyLikeThisFieldQuery("_all").likeText("to"));
    

When I am trying to search with _"stop words"_ It returns 0 documents.  
How to overcome this?
