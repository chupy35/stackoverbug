14862226 ElasticSearch Pagination & Sorting

I am trying to sort search results by a date across multiple pages of results.
Sorting is working within each page, is there a way to sort across the entire
set?

For example: If page 1 has items from Feb 13 through Feb 1st; the second page
should not have items after Feb 1st.

Here is a brief snippet of the request that I am sending. I have also tried
sorting by date then _score, but that produced even stranger results
(primarily, the sort order was the same).

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "from": 0,
        "size": 24
        "sort": [
          "published_on": {
            "missing": "_last",
            "ignore_unmapped": true,
            "order": "desc"
          }
        ]
        "custom_filters_score": {
          "query": {
            "bool": {
              "must": [
                {
                  "match": {
                    "content": "Some query"
                  }
                }
              ]
              ... more ...
            }
          },
          "filters": [
            {
              "filter" => {
                "type" => {
                  "value" => "cats"
                }
              },
              "boost" => 2
            }
            ... more ...
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!

sort, size, from must be in the root

    
    
        {
           query:{
              ...
           },
           sort:[
             ...
           ],
           from:15,
           size:5
        }

In short, I am an idiot.

I was not multiplying the page index by the number of items on the page. I'm
not sure how I missed the same entires on every page, moved up by a single
spot.

I'm sure this will resolve all of the other odd issues that I have been
dealing with.
