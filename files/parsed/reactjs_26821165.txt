26821165 ReactJS: When should setState be guarded by isMounted?

The documentation for the reactjs `isMounted` API mentions that:

> You can use this method to guard asynchronous calls to `setState()` or
`forceUpdate()`.

My primary question is when _should_ a call to `setState()` by guarded by a
call to `isMounted()`?

In the [Initial AJAX Tutorial ](http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/initial-
ajax.html "Initial AJAX
Tutorial")<http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/initial-ajax.html> the
`setState` used in the XHR callback uses the `isMounted()` guard, but is this
required?

A secondary question is, if it is required why is it so? It seems the check
itself is very simple and could be inlined into the `setState()` without any
significant performance penalty, but with a large simplification in API usage.

Logically, isMounted is needed if the component could be unmounted when the
callback is called.

The best practice is to avoid this in componentWillUnmount e.g. aborting an
ajax request, canceling a timeout, or unsubscribing from an event.

Arguably the api is simpler this way because setState doesn't silently fail if
it's called at an inappropriate time. Silently failing causes a lot of bugs
that are difficult to track down.
