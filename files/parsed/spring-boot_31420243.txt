31420243 How can you extend behavior of the spring boot autoconfiguration?

I am looking to extend JacksonAutoConfiguration specifically when the builder
is created, i would like to set that ObjectMapper to a Util class which has
static setter for the ObjectMapper. Look at the line before returning builder
where I would like to set ObjectMpper to a static class.

    
    
    @Bean
            @ConditionalOnMissingBean(Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder.class)
            public Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder jacksonObjectMapperBuilder() {
                Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder builder = new Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder();
                builder.applicationContext(this.applicationContext);
                if (this.jacksonProperties.getSerializationInclusion() != null) {
                    builder.serializationInclusion(this.jacksonProperties
                            .getSerializationInclusion());
                }
                configureFeatures(builder, this.jacksonProperties.getDeserialization());
                configureFeatures(builder, this.jacksonProperties.getSerialization());
                configureFeatures(builder, this.jacksonProperties.getMapper());
                configureFeatures(builder, this.jacksonProperties.getParser());
                configureFeatures(builder, this.jacksonProperties.getGenerator());
                configureDateFormat(builder);
                configurePropertyNamingStrategy(builder);
                configureModules(builder);
                **ObjectMapperUtils.setObjectMapper( builder.build() );**
                return builder;
            }
    

The `ObjectMapper` created from the auto-configured
`Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` is exposed as a bean in the
`JacksonAutoConfiguration`. You could simply create another `@Configuration`
class, get a reference to the `ObjectMapper` (via auto-wiring) and use an
`@PostConstruct` method to set the `ObjectMapper` in your `ObjectMapperUtils`
class.

Another suggestion would be to refactor `ObjectMapperUtils` so that it is
created as a Spring bean itself, then you can auto-wire `ObjectMapper`
directly into it.
