14094162 elasticsearch double quotes not working

I'm trying to search for a specific phrase with elasticsearch i.e. "foo bar".
My query is similar to the one below:

    
    
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/objects/object/_search" -d '{
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "query_string": {
                "query": "\"foo bar\"",
                "default_field": "_all"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }'
    

I've got two objects in my index, looking similar to this:

    
    
    {
      sub_sections: [
        {
          name: "foo"
        },
        {
          name: "bar"
        }
      ]
    }
    

and

    
    
    {
      sub_sections: [
        {
          name: "foo bar"
        }
      ]
    }
    

I'm expecting only the last object, matching the phrase, to be returned when I
use double quotes in the query. However, both objects are always returned.
I've tried options like `auto_generate_phrase_queries` ++ with no luck so far.

Is this the expected behaviour? How could I return only the documents with
exact phrase matches?

By default, both examples are indexed exactly the same way. When multiple
instances of the same field are indexed they are indexed sequentially with no
gap between the last term of one field and the first term of the following
field. That's why phrase searches span field instances. You can increase the
gap between fields by setting `position_offset_gap` in the
[mapping](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/core-
types.html) to a non-zero value. See <https://gist.github.com/4420794> for a
quick demo.
