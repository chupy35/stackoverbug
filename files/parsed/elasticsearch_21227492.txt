21227492 Elastic Search Query for multiple conditions

I want to build a query in Elastic Search which has 3 sub conditions. 1\. It
must satisfy at-least one of list of provided values. 2\. After 1, 2 must be
satisfied and then 3rd condition.

(1 must be satisfied, 2 and 3 also must be satisfied but only after 1 is
satisfied). 1 is a list of values, so anyone satisfying will suffice.

Please give a outline of how to frame the Elastic Search query using boolean
parameters.

Thanks in advance.

    
    
    {
       "query" : {
          "filtered" : { 
             "filter" : {
                "bool" : {
              "must" :[{"term":{"sessionId":"-ShAwL2KlnVeo6nMMNX3ycVlc0kdikOWPC8vShyvpRpdmOQJkbBo-FiLJymsuZp36gcQs1I"}}],
                  "should" : [
                     { "term" : {"visitorId": "b090606f-968d-fef4-33e3-3341f3a04265"}}, 
                     { "term" : {"clientIp": "192.168.8.100"}} 
                  ]
    
               }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    

the terms specified in the must, the documents must match the criteria the
terms specified in the should, any of the term can be matched
