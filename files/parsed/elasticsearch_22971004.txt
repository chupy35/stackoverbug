22971004 Combine a text pattern and a numeric greater-than comparison in a
single ElasticSearch query

I know how to search for an exact match in ElasticSearch:

    
    
    GET world/country/_search
    {
        "query": {
            "match": {
                "GAIN" : "10"
            }
        }
    } 
    

But I want to do a numeric greater-than comparison, and combine it with a text
pattern search. In SQL I would write this:

    
    
    WHERE GAIN > 10 AND DESCRIPTIONLIKE '%good%'
    

How do I do the equivalent in ElasticSearch?

To search for `GAIN > 10` you'll need a [Range
query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.x/query-
dsl-range-query.html).

To search for `DESCRIPTION LIKE '%good%'` you'll need to ensure that the
description field is analyzed in a way that tokenizes it; then you could just
use a regular match query on it, which would find documents that contain the
word `good` (but not `goodbye` \-- depending on the analyzer, but I assume you
want word-boundary tokenization).

To combine the two conditions you'll need a [Bool
query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-bool-query.html).
