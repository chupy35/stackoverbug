25012427 How to set chinese analyzer to a field in elasticsearch

Is there an example how to set chinese language analyzer for certain field in
Elasticsearch?

Documents contain fields with both english and chinese languages and I would
like to configure analyzer for one certain field.

You can try <https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-ik>.

Here are some documents in Chinese:

  * <http://www.nosqldb.cn/1368777631032.html>

  * <http://my.oschina.net/xiaohui249/blog/232784>

Basically, You just need to install the ik-analyzer-plugin and the
dictionaries(by simply copying files), enable it in elasticsearch.yml, and
then set the analyzer to the field you want to use it.
