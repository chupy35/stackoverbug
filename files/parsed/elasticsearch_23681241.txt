23681241 Elasticsearch query dates while using the querystring

I want to to query in the dats while using the querystring.

From what I can read
[here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-query-string-query.html) this should work.

    
    
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": {
                "query": "date:[20100101 TO 20141231]"
    
            }
        },
        "size": 10
    
    }
    

I get no errors but no results either.

I have date fields in the mapping (shortened for your convenience).

    
    
    {
       "cases": {
          "mappings": {
             "texcaseelastic": {
                "properties": {
                   "dateIn": {
                      "type": "date",
                      "format": "dateOptionalTime"
                   },
                   "type": {
                      "type": "string"
                   }
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    

And I have at least a few that should fall in that range.

    
    
    "dateIn": "2011-11-21T00:00:00",
    

Any help would be welcome. Thanks.

There is a typo in your query. You are doing a search by specific field and
your field name is incorrect.

Change `date` to `dateIn`, like the following:

    
    
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": {
                "query": "dateIn:[20100101 TO 20141231]"
    
            }
        },
        "size": 10
    
    }
