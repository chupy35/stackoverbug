18955363 How to use a document with same type as nested in elastic search?

I am using elastic search.  I need to use a self reference in nested
documents.

    
    
    Example: Employee will have manager(Himself an employee). 
    

fields:

    
    
    employee_id - long, 
    employee_name - string 
    manager(document of another employee)
    

I am able to do mapping for employee id, employee name. I am struggling to do
the mapping for manager field. Do I need to map the complete set of
fields(emplyee_id, employee_name) in nested?

Thanks in advance.

With nested document you will have to repeat entire mappings for manager and
manager of the manager and manager of the manager of the manager if you want
to store several levels. It might be better to represent this as parent-child
relationship.
