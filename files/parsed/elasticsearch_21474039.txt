21474039 Multiple routing field in elasticsearch

I am a newbie to elasticsearch. i need a clarification. i can understand how
routing works, but I have a question.

Can i create routing for an document with multiple field. if yes, can i search
the  data using single routing value. Can any on provide any example about it.

Imagine I have 5 fields: `[username,id,age,dept,salary]`. Now i need to create
a routing value for this document. Can I do so using the `username` and `id`
field?

Thanks in advance.

In answer to your question: no, you can't automatically use multiple fields
for a routing value when indexing a document. You can choose one and only one
field, and that field must contain a single value.

However, you could manually concatenate the `username` and `id` field and pass
it in the indexing request:

    
    
    PUT /index/type/id?routing=username_id
    { body }
    

That said, routing is a feature for more advanced users. It is very useful but
does make life more complicated. You say that you're a newbie, so I'd suggest
not playing with routing just yet. That can follow when you're running a 50
node cluster.
