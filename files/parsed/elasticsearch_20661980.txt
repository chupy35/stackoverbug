20661980 What is the difference between enabled : false and index : 'no' in
elasticsearch?

When mapping fields in elaticsearch, what's the difference between setting

    
    
    enabled : false
    

for the field vs setting

    
    
    index : 'no'
    

?

As I understand, `index: no` is applicable to core types only, whereas
`enabled: false` is defined for `object` types and ElasticSearch  specific
fields such as `_index`, `_all`, ...

From the
[documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/enabled.html#enabled):

> The `enabled` setting, which can be applied **only to** the **mapping type**
and to **object fields**. It causes Elasticsearch to skip parsing of the
contents of the field entirely.

Example of `enabled` usage (YAML format):

    
    
    ---
    ...
    _all:
          enabled: false
    ...
