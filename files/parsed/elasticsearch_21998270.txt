21998270 elastic search: filter the documents and then return only the source
without any additional content

Hi im new to elastic search, currently im using

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://blah/blah/_search?pretty=True' -d '{
    "query": {
        "filtered": {
            "filter": {
                "range": {
                    "time": {
                        "from": "2014/02/11 00:00:00", "to":"2014/02/12 00:00:00"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    }'
    

but it will return me sth like this:

    
    
    {
      "took" : 1,
       "timed_out" : false,
       "_shards" : {
        "total" : 5,
        "successful" : 5,
        "failed" : 0
      },
      "hits" : {
        "total" : 2,
        "max_score" : 1.0,
        "hits" : [ {
          "_index" : "blah",
          "_type" : "blah",
          "_id" : "blah",
          "_score" : 1.0, "_source" : {
            "blah" : [...<the contents that really useful to me>..]
    

the additional headers is redundant to me and will cause troubles, the only
thing i need is the contents under the "_source". From the official ES blog i
discover that

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1/_source'
    

will return a "clean" _source, but in practice, i will not know the _id for my
documents, and I will not be able to use the filter in that form (if any one
know how to please tell me). so is there anyway that I can filter my documents
and return a "clean" result that only contains the contents of the "_source"?
Thanks!
