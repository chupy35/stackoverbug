23919296 How is Elastic Search sorting when no sort option specified and no
search query specified

I wonder how Elastic search is sorting (on what field) when no search query is
specified (I just filter on documents) and no sort option specified. It looks
like sorting is than random ... Default sort order is _score, but score is
always 1 when you do not specify a search query ...

You got it right. Its then more or less random with score being 1. You still
get consistent results as far as I remember. You have the "same" when you get
results in SQL but don't specify `ORDER BY`.

Score is mainly used for sorting, Score is calculated by lucene score
calculating using several constraints,For more info **[refer
