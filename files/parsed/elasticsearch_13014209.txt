13014209 Getting old indexed elasticsearch data

I have lot of data indexed in my elasticsearch.

I deleted elasticsearch folder and then extarct again fresh zip of
elasticsearch and start the elasticsearch server.

I am surprised because after staring new elasticsearch server, I again found
all old data and this problem persists again and again.

Can any please help me? I don't want to get all old data indexed in
elasticsearch.

Given the cluster health response it's not a problem with multiple nodes
running on the same cluster as suggested by Igor. I'd suggest you to check the
java processes running. You could maybe have an elasticsearch hanging
somewhere which keeps writing in that folder.
