24840576 elasticsearch how to reset an field for all docs at once?

I have and index with 1mln documents and need to set value `NULL` for field
`status` to ALL documents in this index. Is it possible? Or the only way is to
reindex all documents?

Yes, the only way to do this is to reindex all the documents.

You can update your mapping so that status.null_value = "NULL", so that
documents indexed after that will have that value.
