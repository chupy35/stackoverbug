24677353 Is there any performance gain from making an elasticsearch index
read-only

Though a trivial easy task, am curious as to whether or not this has a
positive performance benefit.

    
    
    curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/my_index/_settings' -d '
    {
        "index" : {
            "blocks" {
                "read_only" : "true"
        } } }
    '
    

I assume you mean 'search performance' (search time) since you try to make
your index read-only.

Without any changes to index (add/delete), the search performance (search
time) should be the same whether it's set to read-only or not.

In both cases, a shard may be optimized to have only one segment. There is no
overhead to maintain/search increasing number of segments inside a shard.
Also, there is no need to merge segments and refresh/flush as well.

Please refer to ElasticSearch official document: [Dynamically updatable
indices](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/dynamic-
indices.html) to understand how an index update is done by ElasticSearch.

Also, according to this [discussion in
Github](https://github.com/elasticsearch/curator/issues/150), Aaron
Mildenstein mentioned:

> It has no improvement on performance whatever.

> Technically speaking, once an index has been optimized to 1 segment per
shard, and had bloom filters disabled, there's not really anything else at the
software level that will improve performance in any way.
