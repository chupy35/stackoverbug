12461783 Elasticsearch, filter for accents

So, while [asciifolding](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-
modules/analysis/asciifolding-tokenfilter.html) would turn `Ã¨` into `e` it
won't filter out a single accent like ```, right? So how can I get rid of
them? For example I want to index `O`Learys` and be able to search for any
variation of `olearys`, `O learys`, `o`learys`.

I don't think it's possible to make `O`Learys` to match both `olearys` and `O
learys` at the same time using analyzers, tokenizers or filters that come with
elasticsearch. It would require to detect presence of ``` and indexing
`O`Learys` twice: first as one token `olearys` and then as two tokens `o`
`learys`. It can be done by writing only with a custom token filter though.

As a workaround, you can make both `olearys` and `o`learys` to match
`O`Learys` by removing character ``` from the input using [Mapping Char
Filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-
modules/analysis/mapping-charfilter.html).
