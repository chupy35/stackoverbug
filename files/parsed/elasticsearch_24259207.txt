24259207 Unable to execute a simple query via elasticsearch-head

I am trying to execute some query on elasticsearch using the plugin head and
the web interface. But at the moment I have no result. It's just a simple
query.

![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xEVv0.png)

So it is what I type in the form. In fact it returns me all the contents of
the indexed dataset. "Origin" is one of my fields and "ROA" a correct value.

Here is a part of the result :

    
    
    {
    
        took: 531
        timed_out: false
        _shards: {
            total: 5
            successful: 5
            failed: 0
        }
        hits: {
            total: 47925065
            max_score: 1
            hits: [
                { 
    

It should return me about 35 000 result.

Thanks for helping.

Ok my bad I found the solution.

I had to set "Post" method isntead of "Get".

And the correct Json was :

    
    
    {
      "query": {
           "match": {
               "Year": "1987"
            }
      }
    }
