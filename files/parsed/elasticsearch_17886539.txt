17886539 Is it possible to run two nodes in elasticsearch but only allow
querying on one?

We have an elastic search cluster set up with two nodes. We want the second
node only for replication as load isn't enough to warrant a second node. All
primary shards are on the master.

Now here's the problem, every _other_ query gets forwarded to the secondary
node. As a result, query times are doubled. I expect this is due to
elasticsearch's load balancing.

Is there a way to prevent queries from being delegated?

If you specify `preference=_local` on the search request url, the request will
be executed on the node that received the request (assuming that this node has
required shards allocated on it). See
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/preference/> for more
information.
