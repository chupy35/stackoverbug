16769626 Elasticsearch Query Between Two Servers

I am new with elasticsearch. I have two elasticsearch servers:

`http://1.20.30.43:9200/`

and

`http://10.30.65.98:9200/`.

In first server i have 100k data and second server i have 100k+1 to 200k data.
I want to search some keywords on both servers in one request. But I have no
idea how I can setup two servers in one request. When cluster name is same

I have no clue which config file I have to change.

we have required these steps

> 1-Put same name o f cluster on both server in elasticsearch.yml file

and then

> 2-Comment these two lines in elasticsearch.yml file

    
    
    > # discovery.ec2.groups: your group
    > # discovery.ec2.any_group: false
    

> 3-If you are using ec2 servers then make accessble on both server

    
    
    4-Restart your both servers
