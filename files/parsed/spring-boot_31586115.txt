31586115 How to reinitialize the LoggingSystem in Spring Boot?

Spring Boots LoggingSystem abstraction has no reload/reinitialize method. Is
there another way of reinitializing the LoggingSystem (regardless of the
underlying implementation)?

What I want to achieve: Registering a SIGHUP-signalhandler triggering a
LoggigSystem-reinit so that the log-filhandles are closed and reopend so
logrotate can rotate the logfiles.
