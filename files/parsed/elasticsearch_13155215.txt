13155215 Elastic Search: Multiple queries and boosting

I want to make a search containing many searches with different boosts, and
having the results returned by score. I tried making a search as follows, and
I thought it worked very well, until I realized that only the first query was
being run.

How should I rephrase this to have a result with all the queries run, and the
results ordered by score, where the scores will be added together if a result
shows up for multiple queries?

    
    
    [{
        "query": {
            "fuzzy": {
                "title": {
                    "value": "lord",
                    "boost": 20,
                    "min_similarity": 0.8
                }
            }
        }
    }, {
        "query": {
            "fuzzy": {
                "location": {
                    "value": "london",
                    "boost": 1000,
                    "min_similarity": 0.8
                }
            }
        }
    }, {
        "query": {
            "fuzzy": {
                "haircolour": {
                    "value": "dark",
                    "boost": 500,
                    "min_similarity": 0.8
                }
            }
        }
    }, {
        "query": {
            "fuzzy": {
                "description": {
                    "value": "senior",
                    "boost": 100,
                    "min_similarity": 0.7
                }
            }
        }
    }, {
        "query": {
            "fuzzy": {
                "description": {
                    "value": "manager",
                    "boost": 100,
                    "min_similarity": 0.7
                }
            }
        }
    }]

Why not creating a bool query for each query with your main query as a must
clause and other queries as should clauses?

Does it help?
