21620325 Elasticsearch multinode environment

In elastic search i created multi-node setup.I use Java Api transport Client
to communicate to Elasticsearch server.

Now i created transport client with only one IP[assume:192.129.129.12.9300].
If i request any query in single ip it communicates all nodes and returns
results. What happen if it my node[192.129.129.12.9300] that i mentioned in
transport Client fails. Can i communicate with other nodes. What is the
optimum way configuration to use transport Client for multi node set up.

You need to activate `sniff` option.

See <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-
api/current/client.html#transport-client>
