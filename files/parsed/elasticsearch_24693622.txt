24693622 Elastic search index number of documents and scores change when
recreating index from scratch

I have been experimenting with elasticsearch, and am stuck on understanding
scoring and indexation.

I created a river/mapping/analyzer (folding, normalization, stemming) and
request to benchmark on. All of this seems to work pretty well, however I
observe that if I delete my index and recreate it with the exact same
configuration, the scores as well as the order of the results of my request
change.

Moreover, the number of documents and the size of the index change upon
recreation (23.718 docs/19.7MB to 20.072/13.5MB for instance) while there is
no sign of error in elasticsearch logs and the query in my river always
outputs the same number of rows.

Is that possibly expected? If not, where should I look and what could be
wrong?

**EDIT:** I am using elasticsearch 1.1.1, with mysql (5.5) river using mysql-
jdbc 5.1.26 and elasticsearch river-jdbc 2.2.2

Thanks in advance
