24340279 Clear all deleted data in Elasticsearch

I'm new to ES, so the question can be somehow stupid, but:

I was experimenting with ES, creating index, putting some data there (1Mio
records), and deleting it after and creating the same (with th—É same name) It
seems that ES is not actually deleting the data in Index (via curl DELETE) as
the disk space is not freed after all the deletes - for now 1Mio records seem
to take 40Gb of disk space)

Is there any way to delete the deleted data totally so it will actually free
space?

If its just for experimentation a quick dirty way would be to delete your data
directory.

Another way to reclaim disk space is to run this command

    
    
    curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_optimize?only_expunge_deletes=true'
