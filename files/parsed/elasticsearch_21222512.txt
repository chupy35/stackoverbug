21222512 Disable IDF calculation

In my particular use case, the IDF-factor that gets calculated as part of the
TF-IDF algorithm messes up the scoring for my queries. Basically, I want the
queries to only take the term frequency into account. Is it possible to
disable the IDF factor, i.e set it to 1, for a particular index? I have looked
into the similarity module (in version 0.90.X), but haven't really found
anything that could help; same goes for the function_score query. Do I need to
write a custom Similarity class in java? Or is there a plugin for what I'm
trying to achieve?

What about constant_score query?

See

tfidf.html>

Don't hesitate to use ?explain=true to see how scoring is working.

As you can here without constant_filter:

And with constant_filter query (that wraps your real query):
