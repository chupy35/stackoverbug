28540443 Spring Boot method entry and exit logging not working

I have the following entry in my application.yml for logging, but it's not
logging the method entry and exit. It's only logging the Tomcat server log.

**application.yml**

    
    
    logging:
        file: ../logs/Audit_Management_DS.log 
    
    level: DEBUG
    

I am deploying my application on Tomcat 8. I have tried this through
application.properties, but it's not working. My entry in
application.properties is as follows:

    
    
    logging.file= ../logs/Audit_Management_DS.log 
    logging.level.*=DEBUG
    logging.level.org.springframework  = ON
    

Your `application.yml` looks like it has whitespace errors, the '*' (asterisk)
in your properties file probably should be "ROOT", and "ON" is not a valid log
level. Fix some or all of those and see if it helps.

(But as the others said in comments, Spring Boot does not log method
executions.)
