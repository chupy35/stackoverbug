11066392 load a expression from another one

Is there any directive or way to load a scope expression from another
expression?

Suppose we have

    
    
    $scope.find = 'a_expression';
    $scope.a_expression = 'found';
    

How could we do something like that?

    
    
    {{ {{ find }} }}
    

`{{$eval(find)}}`

That would do it.
