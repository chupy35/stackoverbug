24624980 Port 9300 on Elasticsearch

According to the documentation, [Elasticsearch reserves port 9300-9400 for
cluster
communication](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-
transport.html) and [port 9200-9300 for accessing the elasticsearch
APIs](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-
http.html). You get the impression that these ranges are _inclusive_ : so port
9300 is part of the first and the second port range.

Now, my IT ops department won't like that, so hopefully I got it wrong. Anyone
knows?

Elasticsearch will bind to a single port for both HTTP and the node/transport
APIs.

It'll try the lowest available port first, and if it is already taken, try the
next. If you run a single node on your machine, it'll only bind to 9200 and
9300.
