20901625 ElasticSearch bulk update

Say we have an documents to index all students information (fields city &
name) .  

At a point If I want to update city of all students with prefix like "NY -"
all in one strech. Can this be done?  

eg:  
David Auburn  
Jack Jamestown  
Claire Newburgh  

Now I need an Single API or ES call which changes all the above documents to

eg:  
David NY-Auburn  
Jack NY-Jamestown  
Claire NY-Newburgh  

I know there is way we can do it one update for each document. but i need ALL
DOCUMENTS IN ONE GO

Thanks Mahesh

Update by query does not exist in ES. I don'think the underlying lucene
indices have a way to update, they delete and re-add always.

[There is some talk about it becoming a thing, maybe in
1.0?](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/1607)

There is a [plugin that can do update by
query](https://github.com/yakaz/elasticsearch-action-updatebyquery/)

You could write a quick script to read and re-post all your docs using any of
the [ES clients](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/unleash-the-clients-ruby-
python-php-perl/).
