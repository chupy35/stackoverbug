19380132 Elasticsearch: which documents include term?

I want to perform some text mining on my elasticsearh database, i.e. calculate
correlation between certain terms, or document clustering.

What i need for that, is to know, which documents include certain term in
given field. For example, if I have these three documents: "Head and
shoulders" "Knees and toes" "Head or tail" than I would like to have search
for term "head" to return either true/false vector (true, false, true), or
list of positions of documents with this term (1 and 3)

Is that somehow possible?

Thanks, Zbynek
