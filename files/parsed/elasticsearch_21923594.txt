21923594 Best way to combined AND and OR in Elasticsearch query

I have documents containing a `tags` array and a `city` field. I try to query
something like this in ES:

**(javascript OR html OR css) AND Los Angeles**

Best way to do that?  
URI solution?

Here is Elasticsearch query to get `(javascript OR html OR css) AND Los
Angeles`

    
    
    {
        "filter": {
            "and": {
               "filters": [
                  {
                        "term": {
                           "city": "Los Angeles"
                        }
                  },
                  {
                    "or": {
                       "filters": [
                          {
                              "terms": {
                                 "tags": ["javascript","html","css"]
                              }
                          }
                       ]
                    }
                  }
               ]
            }
        }
    }
