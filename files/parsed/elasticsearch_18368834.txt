18368834 URI based Elasticsearch query with "starts with" filter

For example, I would like to search for all the names that _starts with_ `Na`.
How do I specify that in the URI based query?

> localhost:9200/index/type/_search?XXX

You can do it like this. Hope that helps you

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/index/type/_search?q=names:na*
