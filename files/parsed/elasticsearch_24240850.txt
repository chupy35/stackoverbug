24240850 query not applying custom score

I'm making the next query, my problem is that the custom score (scrip_score)
is not being applied. Am I doing something wrong?:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "terms": {
                "tactics": [
                  "user_id"
                  "type_user",
                  "browser_plugins",
                  "cashback"
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "script_score": {
          "script": "type_user === 2 ? 1 : 2"
        }
      },
      "from": "0",
      "size": 50,
      "sort": {
        "name": {
          "order": "desc",
          "ignore_unmapped": true
        }
      }
    }
    

The `script_score` section in your query gets ignored. If you want it to be
taken into account you need to wrap you existing `bool` query into a
`function_score` query where you can use the `script_score` part as well.
