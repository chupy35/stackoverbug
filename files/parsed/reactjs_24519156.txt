24519156 React JS triggering re-render when props sorted

I have a react component for a list of data comprised of two sub components

    
    
    <List>
       <SortingAndFiltering data={this.state.data}/>
       <RowsDisplay data={this.state.data}/>
    </List>
    

One subcomponent handles sorts and filters and the other renders the actual
bulk of the data.

When I perform a sort on the props.data inside SortingAndFiltering the event
isn't propagated up the chain.

Whats the correct way to signal that a consumer of a prop has made a change to
this prop?

React doesnâ€™t do _two-way data bindings_ by default and for good reasons.

However, there is an add-on called `ReactLink` that could be of use:

If you are using Backbone as data models, there are mixins that provide
listeners for model changes that can re-render the app when signals are
received from anywhere in the hierarchy.

To dig deeper regarding unidirectional data flow, I recommend this video that
explains the Flux concept used by Facebook:

5,which is similar to yours.
