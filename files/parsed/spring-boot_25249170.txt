25249170 Spring Boot with Legacy tables

I want to use Spring Boot with Legacy database and use hibernate for the same.
I have to access both DB2 and Teradata as data sources.I would like to know if
this is possible ? I'm a newbie to Spring , SpringBoot and have no idea how to
configure data sources , should i still need multiple xml configs etc. The
demos in spring io sites are good but they dont deal with any of my
requirement. Kindly point me in the right direction.

In Spring Boot it is very easy to configure multiple datasources.
[This](http://docs.spring.io/spring-
boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-two-datasources) part of the
documentation describes the procedure in detail.

In essence, all you need to do is have the connection properties in a place
where Spring boot can locate them (the easiest place is
`application.properties`) and then configure the beans. The code would look
like:

**application.properties**

    
    
    datasource.primary.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
    datasource.primary.username=dbuser
    datasource.primary.password=dbpass
    
    datasource.secondary.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test2
    datasource.secondary.username=dbuser2
    datasource.secondary.password=dbpass2
    

**Spring configuration file**

    
    
    @Bean
    @Primary
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix="datasource.primary")
    public DataSource primaryDataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }
    
    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix="datasource.secondary")
    public DataSource secondaryDataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }
    

You will notice that no XML configuration is used which the preferred style
these days. Actually using Spring Boot means that you don't have to write
almost any configuration :)
