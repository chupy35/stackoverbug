19327557 Elasticsearch shard dispursment

I'm still trying to understand how elasticsearch is setup. We have 4 EC2
servers and a loadbalancer, but looking at the elasticsearch _head plugin, the
shards look to be scattered a bit. Is this common, or is there something I'm
missing that I need to look into?

**EDIT:**

as javanna said below, this is just default setup. He explains it in amazing
detail [here in this
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15694724/shards-and-replicas-in-
elasticsearch "here")

Looks like you have four shards for your index and two replicas for each shard
spread over four machines. Each shard exists on two machines. Some machines
have more shards than others. So, seems fine to me and it looks like you are
using the default settings. You will probably want to read up on the
configuration options for this.
