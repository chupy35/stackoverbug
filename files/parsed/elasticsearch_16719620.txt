16719620 ElasticSearch search query processing

I have been reading up on `ElasticSearch` and couldn't find an answer for how
to do the following:

Say, you have some records with, "study" in the title and a user uses the word
"studying" instead of "study". How would you set up `ElasticSearch` to match
this?

Thanks, Alex

ps: Sorry, if this is a duplicate. Wasn't sure what to search for!

For eg: I have indexed book titles and on this query:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "fuzzy": {
                "book": {
                  "value": "ringing",
                  "min_similarity": "0.3"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

I got

    
    
    {
      "took" : "1",
      "timed_out" : "false",
      "_shards" : {
        "total" : "5",
        "successful" : "5",
        "failed" : "0"
      }
      "hits" : {
        "total" : "1",
        "max_score" : "0.19178301",
        "hits" : [
          {
            "_index" : "library",
            "_type" : "book",
            "_id" : "3",
            "_score" : "0.19178301",
            "_source" : {
              "book" : "The Lord of the Rings",
              "author" : "J R R Tolkein"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

which is the only correct result..

You could apply stemming to your documents, so that when you index `studying`,
you are beneath indexing `study`. And when you query you do the same, so that
when you search for `studying` again, you'll be searching for `study` and
you'll find a match, both looking for `study` and `studying`.

Stemming depends of course on the language and there are different techniques,
for english [snowball](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-
modules/analysis/snowball-tokenfilter/) is fine. What happens is that you lose
some information when you index data, since as you can see you cannot really
distinguish between studying and study anymore. If you want to keep that
distinction you could index the same text in different ways using a
[multi_field](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/multi-
field-type/) and apply different text analysis to it. That way you could
search on multiple fields, both the non stemmed version and stemmed version,
maybe giving different weights to them.
