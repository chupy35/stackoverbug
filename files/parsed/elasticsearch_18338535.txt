18338535 Elastic Search - Any way to set filter in CountRequestBuilder

Is there any way to set filters in a CountRequestBuilder like we have
setFilter() in SearchRequestBuilder. Because of this I am unable to use
CountRequestBuilder and using as below

    
    
    SearchRequestBuilder searchBuilder = client.prepareSearch(indexName).setTypes(typeName).setSearchType(SearchType.DFS_QUERY_THEN_FETCH).setExplain(true);           
    SearchResponse response = searchBuilder.execute().actionGet();
    Long count = response.getHits().getTotalHits();
    

Any other ways to get count of search filters?

Top level filter is special construct that should be used only in a few
particular cases such as filtering results without filtering corresponding
facets. So, the best way to solve this issue is by replacing top level filter
with `QueryBuilders.filteredQuery(...)`. Alternatively, you can use
`SearchType.COUNT` instead of `SearchType.DFS_QUERY_THEN_FETCH` to get back
just counts.
