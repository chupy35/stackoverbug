14565888 How can I view the contents of an ElasticSearch index?

I configured a custom analyzer and put some documents into the index. Now I
want to debug my settings so I can see which n-grams actually made it into the
index.

When I used Solr before, there was a possibility to see which strings were
saved in the index as keys and also their frequency.

If you didn't index too much data into the index yet, you can use term facet
query on the field that you would like to debug to see the tokens and their
frequencies:

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/test-idx'
    echo
    curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/test-idx' -d '
    {
        "settings": {
            "index.number_of_shards" : 1,
            "index.number_of_replicas": 0
        },
        "mappings": {            
            "doc": {
                "properties": {
                    "message": {"type": "string", "analyzer": "snowball"}
                }
            }
        }
    
    }'
    echo
    curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/test-idx/doc/1' -d '
    {
      "message": "How is this going to be indexed?"
    }
    '
    echo
    curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/test-idx/_refresh'
    echo
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/test-idx/doc/_search?pretty=true&search_type=count' -d '{
        "query": {
            "match": {
                "_id": "1"
            }
        },
        "facets": {
            "tokens": {
                "terms": {
                    "field": "message"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    '
    echo
    

You can even add the size of the terms (indexed terms). Have a look at
[Elastic Search: how to see the indexed
data](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8954785/elastic-search-how-to-see-
the-indexed-data)

You can view any existing index by using the below CURL. Please replace the
index-name with your actual name before running and it will run as is.

**View the index content**

    
    
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET https://localhost:9200/index_name?pretty
    

And the output will include an index(see settings in output) and its mappings
too and it will look like below output -

    
    
    {
      "index_name": {
        "aliases": {},
        "mappings": {
          "collection_name": {
            "properties": {
              "test_field": {
                "type": "text",
                "fields": {
                  "keyword": {
                    "type": "keyword",
                    "ignore_above": 256
                  }
                }
              }
           }
        },
        "settings": {
          "index": {
            "creation_date": "1527377274366",
            "number_of_shards": "5",
            "number_of_replicas": "1",
            "uuid": "6QfKqbbVQ0Gbsqkq7WZJ2g",
            "version": {
              "created": "6020299"
            },
            "provided_name": "index_name"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

**View ALL the data under this index**

    
    
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET https://localhost:9200/index_name/_search?pretty
