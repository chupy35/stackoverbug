13410072 how to include doc urls in result set

In ElasticSearch, I am wondering how I can get back document urls as well in
the search result set? Here is what I meant with some example.

Let's say I index a doc using the following curl command:

    
    
    curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/ads/offers/1234' -d '{
      "name": "blah blah",
      "Weight":0.0001,
      ...
    }'
    

Then I run a search and I want to get the document URL itself in the result
set. In the above case, the document URL is the following:

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/ads/offers/1234. 
    

How can I do that? Is there a special field name for this or do I have to
create some kind field to store this explicitly?

elasticsearch search response contains all piece that are needed to build this
URL on the client. The record for the URL in you example will look like this:

    
    
    "hits" : [ {
        "_index" : "ads",
        "_type" : "offers",
        "_id" : "1234",
        ...
    

If you really need to get this URL from elasticsearch you can use [script
field](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/script-
fields.html) to combine these pieces together into a single field on the
server side, although I cannot think of a legitimate scenario where it would
be needed.
