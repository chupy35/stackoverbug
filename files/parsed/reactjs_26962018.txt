26962018 ReactTransitionGroup code explanation

I'm new to react and I am trying to get my head around the code in
ReactTransitionGroup and I am confused as to Why performEnter is called in
[componentDidUpdate](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/81d4d7bf242bba3b5e10ff12d224d49dac181f35/src/addons/transitions/ReactTransitionGroup.js#L94)
and not componentDidMount. My understanding of componentDidUpdate is that it
is called after render and when the state has altered.

So I'm confused as to why it is called here.

`performEnter` animates the child, and children are animated in and out when
they appear in or disappear from the parent component on _subsequent_
rendersâ€”they're not animated if they're already contained in the parent upon
the first render.
