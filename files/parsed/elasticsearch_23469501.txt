23469501 Elasticsearch 200 and Green status - no response

After many trials and errors, here is the pattern: 1 Node: Works perfect 2
Nodes: root / query show 200, and cluster health is green, but cannot index
new doc (no response). Search query has no response too. But once I shut down
one node, everything would work again.

I do make sure that port 9300 firewall is open between the nodes. Am I missing
other important config? The cluster API reports 2 nodes, so the communication
should be fine. But is there other factor that prevent new documents from
indexing in the two nodes?
