23158641 ElasticSearch: Can I write query-time plugin like in Solr?

In Solr, I was able to write some query-time plugin to do some kind of query
rewriting (generating sub queries and so on) but in ElasticSearch I can't find
anything similar here. For example, in Solr I created a plugin which creates a
OR sub query with low multiplicative boosting to the original query (by
default the original query is AND). The point here is to show AND results
first followed by OR results since running OR query alone doesn't guarantee
results with all query word show up first.

Here is an example:

  * Let's say I have a query 'A B C'
  * This plugin will be converting this query into the following:
    * AND(A,B,C) + OR(A,B,C)*0.000001

I achieved this by writing a simple runtime plugin in Solr but no idea how to
do this in ElasticSearch.

Any pointer would be appreciated.

If you are looking into boosting you don't need to write a plugin, just play
around with the query DSL (bool query with should clauses) or the
[function_score
query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.x/query-
dsl-function-score-query.html) for more advanced usecases. If that's not
enough you can always write your own query through a plugin, but that's for
even more advanced usecases, you usually don't need to do that.
