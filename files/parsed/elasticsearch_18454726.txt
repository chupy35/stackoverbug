18454726 Does Elastic Search support hot config reloads?

Can elasticsearch reload its config without dropping requests?

similar to how nginx supports the SIGHUP signal.

As far as I know you cannot "reload" the config like you want. But I suppose
you need some changes in your configuration and most of them can be done via
API (that don't require restarting the service). I would take a look at these
links:

[Admin indices update
settings](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
update-settings.html)

[Admin cluster update
settings](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-
update-settings.html)
