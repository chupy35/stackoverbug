23553755 Run Spring Boot Headless

I have a spring boot application and I would like to run it headless. When I
run from the terminal this is the command I'm using:

java -jar myapp.jar --spring.main.headless=true

Is this correct? Any help is well appreciated.

The `spring.main.*` properties are injected into the `SpringApplication`. It
doesn't know anything about heads or headlessness. Maybe you need `java
-Djava.awt.headless=true ...`?

Actually `SpringApplication` does support a headless mode [1], what you've got
should work but is unnecessary as `true` is already the default.

[1] <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-
boot/blob/v1.0.2.RELEASE/spring-
boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.java#L691-L998>

I've faced with same problem and solved it using `SpringApplicationBuilder`
class. You should set `headless` false (which is true by default). See
[javadoc](http://docs.spring.io/spring-
boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/builder/SpringApplicationBuilder.html#headless%28boolean%29).

My main method looks like this:

    
    
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplicationBuilder builder = new SpringApplicationBuilder(App.class);
        builder.headless(false).run(args);
      }
