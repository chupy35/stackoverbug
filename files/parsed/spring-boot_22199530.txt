22199530 Basic interrogation about Spring boot and @EnableAutoConfiguration

I have a basic question about **Spring Boot:**

Say I am developping a **websocket app**. It seems the idea behind Spring Boot
is as follows:

As a **developer** I am responsible for:

  1. Including the following mvn dependency: `spring-boot-starter-websocket`
  2. Annotate my configuration class with: `@EnableAutoConfiguration`

**Spring Boot** is then responsible for applying the following config:
`WebSocketAutoConfiguration`

In a nutshell, is it how it works? Can someone please confirm of infirm the
above?

You are absolutely correct.

After adding _spring-boot-starter-websocket_ to your configuration file and
using the _@EnableAutoConfiguration_ annotation, Spring will use you class
path to automatically determine which configuration settings and beans need to
be created for you.

Spring Boot will handle the _WebSocketAutoConfiguration_ and any other
necessary common configurations.
