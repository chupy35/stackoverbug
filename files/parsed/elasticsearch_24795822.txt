24795822 Search keyword using double quotes to get exact match in
elasticsearch

If user searches by giving quotes around keyword like "flowers and mulch" then
exact matches should be displayed.

I tried using query_string which is almost working but not satisfied with
those results.

Can anyone help me out please.

    
    
    {
        "query": {
            "query_string": {
               "fields": ["body"], 
               "query": "\"flowers and mulch\""
            }
        }
    }
    

You should be using phrase_match for exact matches of phrases:

    
    
    {
        "query": {
            "match_phrase": {
                "body": "flowers and mulch"
            }
        }
    }

> In the same way that the match query is the “go-to” query for standard full
text search, the match_phrase query is the one you should reach for when you
want to find words that are near to each other.

As I put in the comment of the question, I think knowing what the OP found not
satisfying about `query_string` would be great. I would recommend using
query_string for these cases. Note that there are multiple options that could
be set, such as: `auto_generate_phrase_queries`, `split_on_whitespace`, or
`quote_field_suffix` (example:
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/recipes.html#mixing-
exact-search-with-stemming)), which makes it quite versatile.

The case `one "two three"`could be addressed using default parameters of
`query_string`
