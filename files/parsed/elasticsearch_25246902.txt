25246902 In ElasticSearch is there is limit to the number of items in a terms
query?

In the ES docs it lists this sample query:

    
    
    {
      "terms": {
        "tags": [
          "blue",
          "pill"
        ],
        "minimum_should_match": 1
      }
    }
    

Is there a limit (or a practical limit) on the number of items I could put in
the list of possible strings to search for? Could I have a hundred items here?

Yaa, you can put thousands of item there(i've tested).. just follow the
syntax. Then you are ok.
