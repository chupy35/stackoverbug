31166336 How to set embedded tomcat jvmroute

I need to set the jvmRoute used by Spring Boot's embedded tomcat, but it looks
like the only easy way I can do this is by passing in a jvm argument, e.g:
**-DjvmRoute=myroute**

I'd rather set this property in application.properties. Is the jvm argument my
only option, or am I missing something?

Here's what I came up with to solve my problem. Since the
org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine sets the jvmRoute based on a System
property, I simply get my own tomcat.jvmroute property from
application.properties, and set it as a System property in a @Configuration
file:

    
    
    @Configuration
    public class TomcatConfig {
        @Value("${tomcat.jvmroute}")
        private String jvmRoute;
    
        @PostConstruct
        public void setJvmRoute() {
            // embedded tomcat uses this property to set the jvmRoute
            System.setProperty("jvmRoute", jvmRoute);
        }
    }
