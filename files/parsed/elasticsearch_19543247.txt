19543247 ElasticSearch â€” boosting relevance based on position of query words
in the searched string

Need to find a way in ElasticSearch to boost the relevance of a document based
on the position of the query words in the searched string. for example, for
query: "QUERY" the result:

    
    
    'QUERY bla bla bla'
    

will be favored over:

    
    
    'bla bla bla QUERY'
    

Take a look at the function score query, that might be useful for your
problem: <http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/0-90-4-released/#function_score>
