16712642 Elasticsearch enum field

Say I have a field that can only have a finite set of values. Would it not be
more efficient (index-wise, and/or storage-wise) to store it as some kind of
ENUM?

Is there some such possibility in elasticsearch?

An example would be the names of the states in a state machine.

Yes it would. When you index full text fields, Elasticsearch also indexes
information like the length of the field, and the position and frequency of
each term in the field.

These are irrelevant to ENUM values, and can be excluded completely.

In fact, if you _map_ your field as `{"index": "not_analyzed"}` then, besides
storing the exact value that you provide without trying to analyze it, it also
disables storage of the extra info that I mentioned above.

In your app use hash map `{ "enumVal1" => 1, "enumVal2" => 2, "enumValX" => 3
}` and then use in ES only the values from hashmap, this can save space.
