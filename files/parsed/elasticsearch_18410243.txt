18410243 remove unallocated elasticsearch shard

My installation is working fine, but one index is showing yellow health due to
2 'extra' unassigned shards shown in it. How do I remove these extra shards?
My current settings are 0 replicas and 2 shards.

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health/tags?level=shards&pretty=true'
    {
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch_inspire",
      "status" : "yellow",
      "timed_out" : false,
      "number_of_nodes" : 1,
      "number_of_data_nodes" : 1,
      "active_primary_shards" : 2,
      "active_shards" : 2,
      "relocating_shards" : 0,
      "initializing_shards" : 0,
      "unassigned_shards" : 2,
      "indices" : {
        "v1_tags" : {
          "status" : "yellow",
          "number_of_shards" : 2,
          "number_of_replicas" : 1,
          "active_primary_shards" : 2,
          "active_shards" : 2,
          "relocating_shards" : 0,
          "initializing_shards" : 0,
          "unassigned_shards" : 2,
          "shards" : {
            "0" : {
              "status" : "yellow",
              "primary_active" : true,
              "active_shards" : 1,
              "relocating_shards" : 0,
              "initializing_shards" : 0,
              "unassigned_shards" : 1
            },
            "1" : {
              "status" : "yellow",
              "primary_active" : true,
              "active_shards" : 1,
              "relocating_shards" : 0,
              "initializing_shards" : 0,
              "unassigned_shards" : 1
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

Restarting the node seemed to be the only way to solve it.

If anyone has a less-aggressive solution, please post it :)

I recently had this issue where ES process was restarted on all nodes and I
had some unassigned shards (cluster health was red). I did the following to
assign the shards manually and that did the trick for me (no restart was
needed)

    
    
    curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_cluster/reroute' -d '{
      "commands": [
        {
          "allocate": {
            "index": "INDEXNAME",
            "shard": "SHARDNUMBER",
            "node": "PICKANODE",
            "allow_primary": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }'
