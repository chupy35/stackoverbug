28686229 When customizing the management server port, how is this implemented?

When reading through the spring boot documentation
(<http://docs.spring.io/spring-
boot/docs/1.2.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-customizing-
management-server-port>), I see that you can customize the port on which
actuator is running. If I am using embedded tomcat, how is this implemented?
Is this creating another Connector or is it starting up a different instance
of tomcat all together? If it is tomcat, do we have any idea how much more
memory this takes?

It starts a separate embedded instance of Tomcat. The `/metrics` endpoint of
Spring Boot's Actuator or a tool like JConsole will give you some insight into
the heap usage.
