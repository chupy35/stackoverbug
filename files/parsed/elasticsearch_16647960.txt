16647960 ElasticSearch Head: query

I would like to run an ElasticSearch query via the HEAD to extract all brands
currently mentioned in the "brand" field of the index?

How can I do this (not using curl, just via the HEAD)?

You browse to head and then Any Request tab where you can enter the queries as
you like.

There you enter this then: `{ "size" : 0, "query": { "match_all": {} },
"facets" : { "Brands" : { "terms" : {"field" : "brand"} } } }`
