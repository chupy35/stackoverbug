15808818 Sorting on an array of strings in ElasticSearch

I'm using the following to sort documents in Elasticsearch that have a
'usernamesAssigned' property. usernamesAssigned is an array of strings:

    
    
    "sort": [
        {
            "_script": {
                "script": "doc["usernamesAssigned"].values.sort().join()",
                "type": "string",
                "lang": "js",
                "order": "asc"
            }
        }
    ]
    

I'm wondering if there's a more efficient way to do this without using script
based sorting?

This is an old question, but I recently wandered across it while trying to
solve the same problem...

According to the
[documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
request-sort.html):

> Elasticsearch supports sorting by array or multi-valued fields. The mode
option controls what array value is picked for sorting the document it belongs
to.

So, you should be able to sort like this:

`"sort" : [ {"usernamesAssigned" : {"order" : "asc", "mode" : "min"}} ]`

This has been available since version 0.90.0.Beta1.
