27532359 Spring-Boot : Referencing another Spring Boot Project

I created two spring boot projects, one is with JPA and the other with Web. I
initially combined both of them into one project and everything works
perfectly.

I now want to separate the JPA portion from the Web. So I added the JPA
project as a dependency of the Web. But spring-boot is unable to detect the
beans on JPA.

Is there any examples on how to implement this?

I am getting the exception when I tried to autowire the beans from the JPA
project.

    
    
     BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field:
    

The `@EntityScan` and `@EnableRestRepository` by default only scan the sub
packages of the current project so if you want to have two projects you should
implicitly set the path of the other project to be scanned.
