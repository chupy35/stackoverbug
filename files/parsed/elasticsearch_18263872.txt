18263872 transport_address not matching unicast host values in elasticsearch

Hi Elastic Search users,

We are seeing a rather strange issue. I have reviewed the email archives and I
do not see this issue addressed already. We have
discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false in our elasticsearch.yml. The
cluster comes up and the state is green, and the nodes are aware of each
other.

The strangeness is that the transport_address value returned in the cluster
state query does not match the values in discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts - it
is using a different interface on the machines.

Does anyone have any insight?

Values in `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts` are used only for initial
discovery. In other words they are used by a node to find other nodes in the
cluster. An interface that a particular node is binding to or publishing for
other nodes to use doesn't depend on `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts` but
instead it is controlled by `network.host`, `network.bind_host` and
`network.publish_host` settings. See the
[network](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/modules/network/)
section of Elasticsearch guide for more information.
