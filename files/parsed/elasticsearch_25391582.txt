25391582 Elasticsearch: query accuracy

Reading that the elasticsearch may not have a complete accuracy for term
aggregation when setting the size
([link](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html)), I start questioning this: are
the normal queries (without aggregations) accurate when setting `from` and
`size`?

`from` and `size` parameters are only related to the pagination of your
results.

They have no impact on the results accuracy : it's just extracting a subset of
the results computed for the request.

Actually, the things are a little different [see official
explanation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/pagination.html)
