19763248 Special Character "- " in the Elastic Search acting

"-" is acting like a or operator for e.g. I am searching "t-link", then it
showing the result containing "t-link" as well as "t", why it is giving two
terms, but i interested in the "t-link", why it is happening so? How can i
recover from it?

Elasticsearch is using by default the [standard
analyzer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
standard-analyzer.html) for strings.

Basically, your string is tokenized in two tokens, lowercased:

  * t 
  * link

If you need to know what does elasticsearch with your fields, use the
[_analyze
API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
analyze.html).

    
    
    $ curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_analyze?analyzer=standard' -d 't-link'
    $ curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_analyze?analyzer=simple' -d 't-link'
    

If you don't want that, make sure you [put the right
mapping](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
put-mapping.html) for that field and use either a [simple
analyzer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
simple-analyzer.html) or a [keyword
analyzer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
keyword-analyzer.html) or no analyzer at all depending on your requirements.
See also [String core
type](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
core-types.html#string).

    
    
    $ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_mapping' -d '
    {
        "tweet" : {
            "properties" : {
                "message" : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "simple"},
                "other" : {"type" : "string", "index" : "not_analyzed"}
            }
        }
    }
    '
    

Using this form `message` field will be analyzed with `simple` analyzer and
`other` field won't be analyzed at all.
