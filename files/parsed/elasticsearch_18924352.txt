18924352 How can I do a range query on an array in ElasticSearch?

I have documents in ElasticSearch that look like this:

    
    
    {"foo": "bar", "params": [ 123, 456] }
    

How can I search for documents that have the first element of params between
100 and 200? Normally I would just use "range" but I don't know how to refer
to the first index of params when specifying the query.
