22514345 Escaping special characters in elasticsearch on document load

I would like to load some marked up html into a document that is stored in
elasticsearch. What characters besides " s need to be escaped and how do you
escape them?

I would like to test via curl (or sense chrome plugin) so I would not be
relying on any libraries to do format the text.

    
    
    POST index1/doctype 
    {
      "page" : "a",
      "page_time" : "2014-03-19_12-10",
      "html" : "<div class="section" id="idOne"></div>"
    }
    

I found my answer. To escape " s use \ s.
