15204921 Is there a graphic tool to display (and maybe change) elasticsearch
mappings?

I am using <https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head>, which is awesome (!),
but it does not have that functionality.

After putting several mapping into the index, I'd like to be able to view them
graphically. Is that possible?

You can make new indexes, with new mappings. I've used this to translate
logstash mappings from one type to another. I have used [this reindex
plugin](https://github.com/karussell/elasticsearch-reindex) to much success.
It makes the streaming one index into another much simpler and takes
essentially only 2 http requests.

Something like this:

    
    
    $ curl -XPOST http://elnode:9200/<New Index Name> -d @<new mapping>.json
    $ curl -XPUT  http://elnode:9200/<New Index Name>/logs/_reindex\?searchIndex=<Old Index Name>\&searchType=logs
    

Now you have a new index of new mapping with old index's data. You could then
delete the old and make an alias with the old index's name that points to the
new.

A bit of work, but I'd needed it for keeping old logstash data in a new
format.
