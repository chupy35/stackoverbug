11066231 eval on expression of ngrepeat

I would like to access a scope expression, that is assigned to a variable,
through a ng-repeat expression.

So, what I wanna do is something like that:

    
    
    ng-repeat="variable in eval(key)"
    

Unfortunately it is not valid. How can I workaround this?

This would work:

HTML:

    
    
    <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
        <div ng-repeat="item in $eval(key)">{{item}}</div>
    </div>
    

JS:

    
    
    function MyCtrl($scope) {
        $scope.key = "items";
        $scope.items = [1,2,3];
    }
    â€‹
