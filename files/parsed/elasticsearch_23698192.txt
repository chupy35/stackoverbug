23698192 Elastic search : how to get all data of specific field

I'm using the Java API. I want to know how to fetch only a specific field. I
have tried this query in ElasticSearch Head plugin:

    
    
    {"fields": ["name"],"query": { "match_all": {} }}
    

It's working. Now, please help me to write this using the Java API.

The equivalent SQL query would be:

    
    
    select name from user;
    

If you have a query already, all you need to do is something like this:

    
    
    SearchRequest sr = new SearchRequest("your_index");
    sr.source("{\"fields\": [\"name\"],\"query\": { \"match_all\": {} }}");
    ActionFuture<SearchResponse> res = client.search(sr);
    SearchHits hits = res.get().getHits();
    

You can also check out SearchRequestBuilder to help build the requests, but to
me it's easier to build the query elsewhere and then plug it in like this.

If you don't know how to connect a java `client`, see
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-
api/current/client.html>

To use the match all queries in Java api..

    
    
       QueryBuilder qb = QueryBuilders.matchAllQuery();
    

Refer <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-
api/current/query-dsl-queries.html>

I have created a git hub repository.. Refer to use the java
client.<https://github.com/sidharthancr/elasticsearch-java-client>.

HOpe it helps..!
