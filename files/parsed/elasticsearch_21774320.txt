21774320 Elasticsearch Primary Shards not balanced

I noticed a strange behaviour in my elasitcsearch cluster. As you can see on
the screenshot below (it shows the "kopf"-plugin), most of the primary shards
are located on the nl-1 server. I thought, that elasitcsearch balanced the
primary shards evenly over all servers. Am I wrong or why is this happening?

Thank you for your help.

I dont think balance of primaries is a focus of ES.

[See this github issues question about it
here](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3293)

There is a cluster settings you can tweak to nudge towards balancing them.
