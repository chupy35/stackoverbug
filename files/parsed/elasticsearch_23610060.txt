23610060 Multi Field search and Organizing by field

I'am trying to match many fields in elasticsearch and grouping then from each
field

E.g:

I have 5 fields that are
"Team_Wii","Team_PS4","Team_XBOX","Emp_Microsoft","Emp_Teste".

All fields are boolean, and have many entries with true or false

I want to know HOW i can organize these fields to return me the occurrence for
each field.

My query right now:

    
    
    {
      "facets": {
        "Match Team": {
          "query": {
            "multi_match": {
              "query": "true",
              "fields": [
                "Team_*"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

Output:

    
    
        hits:{
        total: 24173305,
        max_score: 1,
        hits:[...]
    facets: {
    Match Team: {
    _type: query
    count: 111343
    }
    }
    

What i am trying to get with the output:

    
    
    hits:{
    total: 24173305,
    max_score: 1,
    hits:[...]
    Facets:{
    Team_wii:{
    Count: 2837}
    Team_PS4:{
    Count: 651}
    Team_XBOX:{
    Count: 321}
