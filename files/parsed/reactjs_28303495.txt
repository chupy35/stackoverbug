28303495 React: Integrate external libraries that have lots of DOM building in
js

Some of the non-react libraries I'm using perform some DOM generation with
javascript. Ideally, I'd like this to occur in react's render cycle but react
doesn't implement some DOM functions.

ie. one library wants to create a fragment for showing a title (using jQuery)
which in turn ends up calling document.createDocumentFragment.

A simple work around is to have the library do it's rendering on component
mount or update. But I'm trying to render using the virtual DOM. Is there a
better approach to re-creating or porting the library?

You need a "Portal". Take a look at <https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-
training/blob/gh-pages/lessons/05-wrapping-dom-libs.md> This explains the
solution very well, like so:

Methodology:

  1. DOM libs usually manipulate the DOM
  2. React tries to re-render and finds a different DOM than it had last time and freaks out
  3. We hide the DOM manipulation from React by breaking the rendering tree and then reconnecting around the DOM the lib manipulates.
  4. Consumers of our component can stay in React-land.
