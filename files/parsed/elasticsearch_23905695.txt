23905695 What is the uses of bool query?

Usually I use the query of "AND", "AND NOT", "OR". Although it seems that a
query can be similarly generated by bool query, What kind of case do you use
the "Bool query"?

There isn't a difference. The keywords "AND", "OR", and "AND NOT" are all just
aliases used by Elasticsearch to internally build up a [boolean
query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-bool-query.html).

I tend to use boolean queries the long way for a few reasons:

  1. That's how I learnt to use them and so I stick with what I know.
  2. I can mix and match the kind of clauses I want, the "AND" and "OR" and even the "AND NOT" can all be used in a mix and match fashion.
  3. With an explicit [boolean query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-bool-query.html) call you can also set the different query types for each one, so one query within the "should" block, which is what "OR" aliases to, could be a [range query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-range-query.html), whereas the other query could be a regular [term query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-term-query.html).
