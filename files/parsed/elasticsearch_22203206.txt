22203206 Checking results of a bulk insert in elasticsearch without "ok": true

1.0 removed the "ok" from responses, and I'm wondering if there's a
recommended way to check if bulk inserts succeeded in the new world.

The documentation comes with the following:

> The response to a bulk action is a large JSON structure with the individual
results of each action that was performed. The failure of a single action does
not affect the remaining actions.
