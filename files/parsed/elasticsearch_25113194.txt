25113194 Boost filter in elasticsearch

I have a book index with fields title, description, author_name, library_id
(where the book located). I want to query books that match a provided string,
and I also give an array of library_ids for ranking purpose. The results with
library_ids that belong to the provided list of library_ids should be ranked
higher (higher score).

Is it possible to perform this type of query?

You can try using ids query

    
    
    {
       "query": {
          "function_score": {
             "functions": [
                {
                   "boost_factor": "50",
                   "filter": {
                     "ids": {
                        "values": [
                           "library_ids"
                        ]
                     }
                   }
                }
             ],
             "query": {
                "match_all": {}
             },
             "score_mode": "sum"
          }
       }
    }
    

library_id must be the "_id" field.
