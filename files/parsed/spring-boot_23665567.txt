23665567 Use Spring Boot to package and run an existing WAR file

Is there a way I can use Spring Boot to package and run an existing WAR file
without modifying the WAR?

Thanks!

You could use the Boot plugins to create a WAR that contained the embedded
container jars, and a launcher for a main method. You'd have to provide a
main() method, so really that's where it would potentially become problematic.
Look for tutorials on the web about how to launch an embedded container, or
inspect the code in Boot that does it. Spring Boot has such a lot of
convenient embedded container features and you might end up re-writing quite a
bit of it.
