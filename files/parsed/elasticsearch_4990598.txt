4990598 How to get all the values from an search result

I am new to Elastic Search. Is there any way to get all the search results for
a search keyword? Elastic Search is limited to 10 or else we can set the size
but we need to get the size??

Yes, the default number of search results is 10.

You need to [set the `size`
parameter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/from-
size.html) on the query.

I don't think you an say "all results", though, there must always be a size
limit.

If you use the JAVA API you can simple get the total hit number from the
SearchResponse

    
    
    SearchRequestBuilder srb = ..
    SearchResponse sr = srb.execute().actionGet();
    long totalHits = sr.getHits().getTotalHits();
    

You can do this in couple of steps using some code

  1. Fix a size say `1000` and get all 1000 records.
  2. Identify from `hits.total` whether size is smaller than 1000. (if small then you got all the records :) )
  3. Otherwise use [from and size](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-from-size.html) to provide `1001` in from and `total` as size from previous query to get full result.
