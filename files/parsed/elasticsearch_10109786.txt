10109786 In elasticsearch, is there a way to show which field in a document
was the "hit"?

When searching some documents using elasticsearch, I'd like to see which field
in the document was the "hit" that flagged it up as a search result. Is there
a native way to do this, or do I need to do it in the search client?

E.g:

    
    
    GET /events/_search?q=nottingham
    

gives me:

    
    
    {//elided
        {'hits'[
           {'id':1,
            'name': 'Some name',
            'nicknames': ['Nottingham']
           }]}}
    

it's obvious from this example that the nickname matched, but can I get
elasticsearch to flag that for me?

Elasticsearch can find and highlight terms from your query in the result
fields. See
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/highlighting.html>
for more information. Technically speaking, it's not the same as flagging
fields that caused the "hit", but for most practical purposes, it's as useful.
