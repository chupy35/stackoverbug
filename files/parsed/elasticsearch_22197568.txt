22197568 Failed "delete by query" query in Elasticsearch

I made a simply query

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'http://rtparamdev03:9200/_all/_query?pretty=true' -d '
    {
    "query": {
        "constant_score": {
            "filter": {
                "missing" : { "field" : "path" }
            }
        }
       }
    }'
    

I am getting a failure response.

    
    
    {
    "ok" : true,
    "_indices" : {
    "alerts" : {
      "_shards" : {
        "total" : 5,
        "successful" : 0,
        "failed" : 5
      }
    },
    "logstash-2014.02.12" : {
      "_shards" : {
        "total" : 5,
        "successful" : 0,
        "failed" : 5
      }
    ...
    }
    

I don't see anything obvious in the ElasticSearch log. I see the following but
I don't think that it's relevant at all.

I did an `all refresh` and I set `threadpool.index.queue_size=-1`. I'm still
getting the same response.

Any advice please?

You can use the query string technique for Delete by query.

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/<index>/<type>/_query?q=<attributeName>:<attributeValue>'
