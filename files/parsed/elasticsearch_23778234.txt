23778234 Elasticsearch [mlt] query does not support [ids]]

I recently update elasticsearch from 0.9x to 1.0.3, and i find more_like_this
add a new parameters: ids from doc
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-mlt-query.html>. However when i want to use it like:

    
    
    {
      query: { 
        more_like_this: {         
          min_term_freq: 1,
          max_query_terms: 12,
          min_doc_freq: 1,
          ids: ["doc_id_xxxxx"]
        } 
      }
    }
    

It returns: **nested: QueryParsingException[[index] [mlt] query does not
support [ids]];**

but when changing ids to like_text, it works fine.

Thanks for any help.

The issue is caused by the official document is a little earlier than version
release. So the parameter will be available when 1.2.0 is out.
