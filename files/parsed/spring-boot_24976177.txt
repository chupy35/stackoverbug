24976177 Externalizing logging in Spring Boot apps

I'm trying to externalize logging configuration. However, any configuration I
establish (e.g. `-Dlogback.configurationFile=...`) is wiped out the moment I
call `SpringApplication.run()`. Is there a way to prevent this?

Try 'logging.config' (or use one of the the conventional locations, e.g.
'classpath:/logback.xml'). Docs here: <http://docs.spring.io/spring-
boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-custom-log-
configuration>.
