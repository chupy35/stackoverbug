17144345 how to search and retrieve data based on of indexed data in
elasticsearch

i had indexed the data and elasticsearch allocate it a version. Now I had
updated the indexes by **update API** a new version will be allocate to it.
Now I want to search data based on version. For eg: my original indexed data
is (version=1) :

    
    
      {
         "name":"Lav"
      }
    

after execution of update query (version=2) :

    
    
      {
         "name":"Lav",
         "message":"hello elasticsearch"
      }
    

Now I want to perform search operation first in version 1 and then in version
2 . How it can be done

If I understand well your question, you want to make a search based on the
values your document had in its version 1.

In fact, the `version` field is just an additional information added to the
document. ElasticSearch doesn't keep the values of fields for older versions.
Therefore, it's not possible to do a search on the data of an older version.

The `version` field is useful primarily to do some "Optimistic concurrency
control" like explained in [this blog
post](http://www.elasticsearch.org/2011/02/08/versioning/).
