24837970 Elasticsearch - How to secure (lock) mapping from accidental deletion

let us say here is the mapping

localhost:9200/index/mapping

now

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/index/mapping/id'
    

this will delete the record with the given id

but if we miss the /id by mistake that is

    
    
    curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/index/mapping'
    

then elasticsearch will delete the mapping completely.

How to avoid this? is there any configuration option available in
elasticsearch to lock the mapping from deletion?

There is no configuration setting, index setting, or map setting that will
prevent disallow this operation.
