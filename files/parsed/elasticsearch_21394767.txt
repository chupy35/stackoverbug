21394767 Failed to derive xcontent from
org.elasticsearch.common.bytes.BytesArray@0

My curl query works

`curl -v -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/entityitem/5/_mget' -d '{"ids" :
["5000027585", "5000027615"]}'`

but when I use the rest client to do GET query

`http://localhost:9200/entityitem/5/_mget?source={"ids" : ["5000027585",
"5000027615"]}`

I get the following error

> Failed to derive xcontent from org.elasticsearch.common.bytes.BytesArray@0

Try this

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/entityitem/5/_mget?q=ids:5000027585%20OR%20ids:5000027615
    

q is query. ids is your field. The URL above is equal to query

> ids:5000027585 OR ids:5000027615

That's the lucene syntax supported by Elasticsearch. Remember to use %20 to
replace space.

Yeah. It's an issue.

I just fixed it yesterday. See
<https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/4892>

If you get this while following the kibana tutorial you may be trying to
import the shakespeare.json file. You probably downloaded to downloads folder
and are running the import command in another folder. Move the input file to
the current directory...

    
    
    mv ~/Downloads/shakespeare.json .
    

and run your curl xput command to import the shakespeare data.

    
    
    curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary @shakespeare.json
