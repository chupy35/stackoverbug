23034318 How to handle html encoded text in Elastic search?

In one of our applications, we mainly work with html encoded text on which we
want to search. I could strip the html tags before adding the document to
Elastic search (I have a field with the complete text containing the html tags
and one without, the stripped version).

I was wondering whether there is a standard analyzer available so that I do
not have to strip the html tags "myself", beforehand ...

Hope somebody can be of assistance ...

The [html_strip char
filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
htmlstrip-charfilter.html) should help:

example :

    
    
    curl -XPOST "http://<server>/_analyze?tokenizer=standard&char_filters=html_strip&text='This%20is%20a%20%3Cb%3EDOCUMENT%3C%2Fb%3E%20with%20html'"
