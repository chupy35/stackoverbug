24153852 Where can I find a formal definition of the elasticsearch DSL?

The elasticseach documentation is very informal. For example, [Filtered
Query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-filtered-query.html) does not specify if the "query" or the "filter" part
is required. There is a comment under "query" that says `query definition`,
but there is no further explanation what this is supposed to mean. To
interpret the documentation, a lot of guesswork is needed to figure out what
is legal.

Where can I find a formal definition of the elasticseach DSL?

I found [Elasticsearch Query DSL
documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl.html) to be quite comprehensive.

I guess in the example you highlight, it is a bit tricky. Filtered Query is a
chain to the results of another query.

The `query definition` and `filter definition` of Filtered query maps to
[queries](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-queries.html) and
[filters](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-filters.html) section of the Query DSL (probably not obvious). You could
use any of the queries (match etc.) and any of the filter (exists etc) in the
filtered query payload.
