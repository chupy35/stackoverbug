9685673 How to search in multiple fields with OR statement in ElasticSearch

A have a string, let's say "Ab Cd"

I have documents with fields: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', ... 'z'] (not all documents
have all fields)

I want search only in fields 'a', 'c', 'f', 'x' but I want to return all
fields in document.

Hit is successful if ANY of fields 'a', 'c', 'f', 'x' contains string
beginning 'Ab' or 'Cd'.

Now I use this but it searches in ALL fields not in selected ones.

    
    
    {'query': {'query_string': {'query': "Ab* Cd*"}}}
    

It's possible to specify list of fields that you want to search by default as
part of the query:

    
    
    { 
        "query": { 
            "query_string" : {
                "fields" : ["a", "c", "f", "x"],
                "query" : "Ab* Cd*"
            } 
        }
    }
    

Alternatively, you can prefix every term with the name of the field:

    
    
    {'query': {'query_string': {'query': "a:Ab* c:Ab* f:Ab* x:Ab* a:Cd* c:Cd* f:Cd* x:Cd*"}}}
    

Check [Query String Query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-
dsl/query-string-query.html) page of elasticsearch Guide that describes these
and other useful options.

This is exactly what I was looking for. In case anyone looking for a java
version of this:

    
    
     QueryStringQueryBuilder qsqb = new QueryStringQueryBuilder("Ab* Cd*")
              .field("a", 2)
              .field("b")
              .field("c")
              .field("f")
              .field("x");
    

You can even use the field level boosting if you want as shows for field "a"
in above code.
