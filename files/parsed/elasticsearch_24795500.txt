24795500 Elasticsearch sort by date only of datetime

I have a field 'datetime' with value like '2014-07-17T01:20:20', on my query I
want to sort it by just date like (2014-07-17). Is it possible to sort this
way in elasticsearch?

I want to have something like this in database query: order by DATE(datetime)
DESC, name ASC

Thanks!
