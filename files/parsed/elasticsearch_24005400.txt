24005400 If a property in elasticsearch is neither indexed nor stored and the
_source is also disabled, does the property affect storage space?

    
    
    POST /twitter/tweet/_mapping
    {
      "tweet" : {
        "_source" : {"enabled" : false},
        "properties" : {
          "user" : {"type" : "string", "index" : "no", "store" : false}
        }
      }
    }
    
    POST /twitter/tweet/1
    {
      "user": "John Doe"
    }
    

Using the above _mapping and document, will the property value "John Doe" be
stored anywhere by elasticsearch?

Also, apart from being displayed in the _mapping, is there any other role of
the 'user' property?

I was investigating the same doubt. As per ES documentation (1) in your case
the original json you 'index' should be stored but the ES index will not
contain any reference to that field.

store: Set to true to actually store the field in the index, false to not
store it. Defaults to false (note, the JSON document itself is stored, and it
can be retrieved from it).
