27617503 No log messages after Spring Boot upgrade

I have recently upgraded spring boot from 1.1.10 to 1.2.0. I did not specify
version information for spring boot dependencies like spring mvc. So they also
got upgraded.

After upgrade, I am not able to see any log information from spring. I am able
to see the sysout and syserr information of my code though.

Did any thing change in the latest relese ?

As per the changelog [Spring Boot 1.2.0 changelog](https://github.com/spring-
projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-1.2-Release-Notes#logging-output) Spring
Boot's default behavior is to not write any log files.

Sorry folks, I have a log4j.properties in my class path. That configuration
file prevented entries from springframework packages. Not sure how it ended up
there though. Probably 1.1.10 is not picking it up. Things might have changed
with 1.2.0. Hence the problem. Once I deleted that file, every thing is
working fine

Thank you for your time
