13554845 Is there a limit to the number of indexes an ElasticSearch alias can
point to?

I have this alias that I want to point to 60 indexes. At 21 indexes, I start
getting Execution Rejected exceptions.

Is this because of a 20 index limit in the alias API?

Assuming that you have 5 shards per index, a request against 21 indices may
generates about 105 shard requests, 32 of these requests are sent to threads
in the pool and 73 request go into the queue. At this moment you have only
about 27 elements in the queue left. So, if another request against 6 or more
indices (30 shards) arrives, some shardsrequests are going to be rejected with
Execution Rejected Exception. I am oversimplifying the situation here quite a
bit and the actual number of threads used depends on many factors including
where shards are located, search settings, etc. However, I hope you can see
the main idea here: if you want to search against a large number of shards,
you need to make sure you have enough capacity in the thread pool to handle
the peak load.
