14962163 Tiebreaking in Elastic Search

If I'm making queries to ElasticSearch using a custom score filter, how does
it handle the case when documents have the same score?

Are they returned in the order they were inserted, or can I specify how the
case should be handled?

Ideally I'd like them to be returned in a random order if possible.

Right now you are sorting by `_score`. So, you can add a second sort key that
will contain a script with random number generator. See [Random order &
pagination Elasticsearch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9796470/random-
order-pagination-elasticsearch) for a couple of different examples.
