24876101 Elasticsearch: different queries on different fields in a single
query

I am new to Elasticsearch. I wonder how to use different queries on different
fields in a single query. For example, match query on field 1 and field 2,
term query on field 3.

Any info is really appreciated.

Thanks and regards.

You should take a look at the Elasticsearch Bool Query:

> **Bool Query**

>

> A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other
queries. The bool query maps to Lucene BooleanQuery. It is built using one or
more boolean clauses, each clause with a typed occurrence.

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-bool-query.html>

And the related Bool Filter:

> **Bool Filter**

>

> A filter that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other
queries. Similar in concept to Boolean query, except that the clauses are
other filters. Can be placed within queries that accept a filter.
