25073873 GroovyTemplates properties configuration

I'm trying to configure the properties of GroovyTemplates. I checked the
[reference](http://docs.spring.io/spring-
boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html) document,
but formatting options are not available through the _application.properties_
file. So I did the following to customize some other properties.

    
    
    @EnableAutoConfiguration
    @Configuration
    @ComponentScan
    public class Application implements CommandLineRunner {
    
        @Autowired
        private GroovyTemplateAutoConfiguration.GroovyMarkupConfiguration configuration;
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
        }
    
        @Override
        public void run(String... strings) throws Exception {
            this.configuration.groovyTemplateConfiguration().setUseDoubleQuotes(true);
            this.configuration.groovyTemplateConfiguration().setAutoNewLine(true);
            this.configuration.groovyTemplateConfiguration().setAutoIndent(true);
    
        }
    }
    

I can see the double quotes in the rendered HTML files. However, it is still
unformatted.

So, I have two questions. The first one is, how can I set the properties
properly? Most probably, the one I did is not the proper way. The second
question is, why do I still get the unformatted HTML?

In the docs it says

    
    
    spring.groovy.template.configuration.*= # See Groovy's TemplateConfiguration
    

So I assume that corresponds up the properties you set (what you are doing
isn't wrong, necessarily, but it might happen too late to influence the
behaviour at runtime). I would stick with the `application.properties` if I
were you.
