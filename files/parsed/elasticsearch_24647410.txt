24647410 How to insert data into the index in ElasticSearch using Java

I am new to the Elastic Search. I had done insert, update and search through
using CURL. I need to know how can I implement this by using java. Are there
any methods?

Thank you

I will give you an example from elasticsearch official documentation :

    
    
    import static org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.XContentFactory.*;
    
    IndexResponse response = client.prepareIndex("twitter", "tweet", "1")
        .setSource(jsonBuilder()
                    .startObject()
                        .field("user", "kimchy")
                        .field("postDate", new Date())
                        .field("message", "trying out Elasticsearch")
                    .endObject()
                  )
        .execute()
        .actionGet();
