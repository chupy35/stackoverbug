17623598 Is a geo_distance query with linestring or multipolygon geo type
possible?

I have not been able to find any examples of this, but I have multipolygon
shapes (and will be operating on linestrings once I figure this out) stored in
ES and need to find the closest point of the multipolygon (or linestring) from
a given point.

Is this even possible ES?

TIA.

at the moment ES just supports the basic operations on shapes. This means if
shapes are _disjoint_ , _intersect_ or if one lies _within_ another. Distances
between geo_shapes could not be calculated so far. To be able to solve you
problem, you need to index the shapes control points separately as geo_points
and filter these by distance. I think in the near future ES will at least
support calculation of distances between shapes.
