23219772 spring-boot and AspectJ based LTW without Java agent

I've been having very hard time trying to make it work on my end. What I want
to achieve is bringing up my spring-boot project that would weave all Java
classes with AspectJ when I just run "java -jar app.jar" (Tomcat 8 embedded is
used) without any Java agent params.

Is this generally possible? And if yes, what are the required config stuff
that should be paid attention to?

Thanks a lot in advance.

It might be possible, but you would probably (at a minimum) need a custom
`main()` method that created an LTW classloader and used that to launch your
app. The default classloader in the `java -jar` would not be LTW-enabled. Any
reason you don't want to use an agent (since you obviously control the
launcher)?

Here a library that initializes aspectj and spring-aspects at runtime by
injecting instrumentation: <https://github.com/subes/invesdwin-instrument>

You can use it as a sample.
