22093253 How to make a RESTful query to the elasticsearch search API for logs
within a certain @timestamp range.

I am trying to query elasticsearch for all logs that have a @timestamp within
a certain range. This is being done by a $.get() request using jQuery. My
attempts so far have resulted in queries not within the time range. I am
listing the logs on my own HTML page and although I have tried different query
messages I always get one of two responses, one with times starting at 4:25
and the other with times starting at 6:39. I don't know if this is useless
information but I thought it could be useful in understanding the nature of
the problem.  So this is the message I have written myself.

    
    
    {
            "query" : {
            "filtered": {
                "query" : { "match_all" : {}},
                "filter": {
                    "range" : {
                        "@timestamp": {
                            "from" : 1393580102248,
                            "to" : 1393583702248
                        }
                    }
                }
    
            }       
        }
    }
    

We are also using Kibana (working) and I have tried copying and pasting the
same exact query Kibana uses, with the SAME results as my query above.

    
    
    {
      "query": {
    "filtered": {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "should": [
            {
              "query_string": {
                "query": "*"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "filter": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "match_all": {}
            },
            {
              "range": {
                "@timestamp": {
                  "from": 1393580102248,
                  "to": 1393583702248
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "bool": {
                "must": [
                  {
                    "match_all": {}
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
     },
      "highlight": {
    "fields": {},
    "fragment_size": 2147483647,
    "pre_tags": [
      "@start-highlight@"
    ],
    "post_tags": [
      "@end-highlight@"
    ]
      },
      "size": 500,
      "sort": [
    {
      "@timestamp": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
     ]
    }
    

What am I doing wrong? I can change the time range as well and I still get the
same results.
