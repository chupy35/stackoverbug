9063742 elasticsearch: how can i boost documents having sub-objects

How can i _boost_ documents having sub-objects over documents without having
such sub-objects even if i don't query directly for information of sub-
objects?

Here an example:

I put events in my search index. Each event has a name and optional one ore
more dates. you can search for events by name. I want the matching events with
dates to become the first results. Events that also match by name but don't
have a date should come afterwards.

You can create "has_dates" field and use boosting query boosting objects with
"has_dates" field.
