19113764 Can ElasticSearch return elements of an array of a single document?

With a document like:

    
    
    {
        "obj1" : [
            {
                "name" : "blue",
                "count" : 4
            },
            {
                "name" : "green",
                "count" : 6
            }
        ]
    }
    

Is it possible to query for a `obj1.name = "blue"` to obtain the matching
element of the array, not the document?:

    
    
    {
        "name" : "blue",
        "count" : 4
    }
    

Thanks in advance!

I think it is not possible now. But there is open
[issue](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3022) for
returning nested inner objects.
