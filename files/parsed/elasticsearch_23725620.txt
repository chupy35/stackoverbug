23725620 Automatically decide document type

I have a large database with two different types of documents and I want them
to be indexed in ES as different document types in ES terms as well. But I
don't want to prefilter my database.

Is it possible to configure ES so it will set the type of the documents
according to its structure during indexing?

To give more information:

I'm indexing tweets from the twitter api. But I not only have tweets in json
format but also json documents which say to delete a tweet in the database. I
want to index these two documents so that they are unique. For the tweets I
ensure that by setting the tweet ID to the document ID with a mapping. But I
can't do the same on the delete docs because then I would overwrite the
tweets. Separating the two by setting them to different docs but both use the
same ID would ensure that, but I'm open for other suggestions.

The delete docs look like this:

    
    
    {"delete":
        {"status":
            {"id":417427762463649792,
            "user_id":608116073,
            "id_str": "417427762463649792",
            "user_id_str":"608116073"}
        }
    }
    

And the tweets like this(excerpt):

    
    
    {"created_at":
        "Sun Dec 29 22:59:59 +0000 2013",
        "id":417429821849743360
    [...]
    }
    

I want to index with stream2es or elasticsearch-hadoop.

Thanks!
