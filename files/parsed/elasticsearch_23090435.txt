23090435 Elasticsearch Multi Get with Aggregation

Can you use the Multi Get API with aggregation/facets?

For example, if I store documents called Shapes and I have 500 shape_ids, each
shape has a side_count and I'd like to find out the average side_count of that
list of shape_ids.

A get request is very different compared to a search request. A get doesn't
imply any query as given index, type and id (or routing) of a document we know
where it is (which shard), thus the document is retrieved from the interesting
shard and returned. Multi get is just a variation that does the same with
multiple documents, in a more optimized way as it groups get requests per
shards, minimizing the network roundtrips. Note also that get is real-time, as
documents can either be retrieved from the lucene index or from the
elasticsearch transaction log if not available yet for search.

Aggregations require a search request and cannot be run on top of documents
returned by get requests. You might be able to achieve the same result though
using the search api and the [ids
filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-ids-filter.html) instead of the multi get.
