23705338 what does calling _close on an elasticsearch alias do?

I've got a ton of indices sharing the alias **events**. I called **_close** on
the **events** alias and now I can't search the **events** alias at all, even
if I reopen it using **_open**.

The error I'm getting is:

    
    
    {
       "error": "ClusterBlockException[blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/4/index closed];]",
       "status": 403
    }
    

If I make an **_aliases** call, I get back

    
    
    "aliases": {
        "events": {}
    }
    

for all of the pertinent indices so it seems like they are all aliased
correctly. Searched the ES documentation but couldn't find much.

<clarification> seems like calling **_open** on the **events** alias just
reopens all the indices with that alias, and calling **_close** just closes
them all. which is what i expected to happen.

Calling close on an elasticsearch alias does exactly what you'd expect it to
-- closes all the indices with that alias. Not sure if this is the best
solution, but I ended up re-aliasing closed indices so they were still marked
but don't cause searching the alias to fail.
