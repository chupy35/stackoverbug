19722350 Elasticsearch: Disable the Versioning of index document

I could see the ElasticSearch versioning the index documents for every update.
I would like to know if there is a way to disable these versions? I understand
its a good to have functionality, but its just for exploring the tool. Also is
there is any performance concerns with large number of versions?

Thanks

Versioning doesn't mean that elasticsearch keeps every version of the
document. It keeps only the latest one. Every document has by default an
implicit `_version` field, that gets incremented whenever the document
changes. That allows for optimistic locking if you need it. You can also have
your own external versioning system if you want. Have a look at [this
article](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/elasticsearch-versioning-support/)
that is all about versioning with elasticsearch.

This doesn't hurt performance at all, I wouldn't look into disabling it.
