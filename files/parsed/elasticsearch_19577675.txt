19577675 Elasticsearch: Turn off logging for a single local node

I have a single local node which I'm initializing and connecting to with

    
    
    node = NodeBuilder.nodeBuilder ().local (true).node ();
    node.start ();
    Settings settings = ImmutableSettings.settingsBuilder ()
                .put ("node.local", "true").build ();
    client = new TransportClient (settings)
                .addTransportAddress (new LocalTransportAddress ("1"));
    

When I use the client, there's a massive amount of debug logging that's
outputted. Is there any way to disable to the logging?

I believe you can control the logging via the config/logging.yml file for
elasticsearch.

It uses log4j, so just include a log4j, so just include a `log4j.properties`
file to control the logging level.

For example you can have it contain only this line `log4j.rootLogger=ERROR,
stdout` to only output errors
