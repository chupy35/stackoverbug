I have created an application as spring boot application,Now i want to
integrate this application with wily,where i ll passed wily parameter in
application to configure application.

The fact that it's a Spring Boot application shouldn't make any difference. If
you're using an executable jar file, you'll need to configure the agent when
you launch the jar, for example:

    
    
    java -jar my-app.jar -javaagent:<Agent_Home>/Agent.jar -Dcom.wily.introscope.agentProfile=<Path_To_Agent_Profile>
    

If you're deploying your Spring Boot application as a war file to a servlet
container or application server, you'll need to be make the equivalent
configuration changes. The [documentation describes how to configure
Tomcat](https://support.ca.com/cadocs/0/CA%20Application%20Performance%20Management%20as%20a%20Service%201%201%201-ENU/Bookshelf_Files/HTML/APMS
