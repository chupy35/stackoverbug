23930320 ElasticSearch stored field

Is is absurd to store some fields while `_source` is already enabled? In
documentation of elasticsearch
[here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
core-types.html) as it is specified fields are not stored by defult but we can
retrieve them from `_source`, If we set a field as stored while `_source` is
also enabled, will there be duplicate of this field?

Yes it will be stored twice.Field store is used to speed up the process
.Instead of fetching _source and fetch the field will be slower than stored
fields.It will directly fetch data from stored field.
