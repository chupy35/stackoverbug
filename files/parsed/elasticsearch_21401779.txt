21401779 Is elastic search data access sync or async?

As i am new to elastic search.how will elasticsearch work in concurrency.How
search work and write/update/delete work in one node.Every request is
processed one by one or it wil work simutaneously.

    
    
     will it support transaction ??
    

Thanks in advance..!

CRUD requests happen in parallel within a single shard (you can have multiple
shards on a single node). Transactions are not supported.

A bulk request (multiple CRUD requests in a single request) and processed
serially on a single shard, but you can have multiple bulk requests processed
in parallel on a single shard. They don't support transactions either. The
success or failure of one request within a bulk request doesn't affect the
others.

To ensure that one update doesn't overwrite changes from another,
Elasticsearch provides optimistic concurrency control: you specify the
`version` number of the doc you want to update. If the current `version` is
different, then the update will fail and you can take the appropriate action.

See
[versioning](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-
index_.html#index-versioning) and the `retry_on_conflict` parameter on the
[update
API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-
update.html).
