21344288 How to provide elasticsearch TTL per index document operation?

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
ttl-field.html> seems to indicate that a TTL can be set per query (I'm
assuming this means it can be set on a per index operation basis). How is that
done?

Is it just a matter of doing something like:

    
    
    client.prepareIndex('index-name', 'type-name')
            .setSource(jsonBuilder()
                        .startObject()
                            .field('_ttl', '1d')
                            .field('other-field', 'other-value')
                        .endObject()
                      )
            .execute()
            .actionGet();
    

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-
index_.html#index-ttl> indicates that what you have should work.
