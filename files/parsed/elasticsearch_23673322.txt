23673322 Elasticsearch custom_filters_score not working

I am trying to test with custom_filters_scores in elasticsearch but even the
most basic versions are producing errors. Can anyone point out why the
following error message is occurring?

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "custom_filters_score": {
          "query": {
            "match_all": {}
          },
          "filters": [
            {
              "filter": {
                "range": {
                  "Price": {
                    "from": 0,
                    "to": 200
                  }
               }
             }
           }
         ],
       }
    }
    

The error is as follows:

    
    
    nested: QueryParsingException[[index] No query registered for [custom_filters_score]]; }]", "status": 400
    

You're probably using elasticsearch 1.x that has a new query that handles all
the different boosting usecases. It's called `function_score` and it replaced
the `custom_filters_score` in 1.0, already deprecated since `0.90.4`.

Have a look at the [documentation
page](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-function-score-query.html), it's quite extensive and contains at the
bottom of the page examples on how to migrate from previously available
queries to `function_score`.
