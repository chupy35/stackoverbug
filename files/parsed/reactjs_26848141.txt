26848141 Why does data-reactid contain a function implementation and how can I
get rid of it?

I don't know what I've done, but for some reason most rendered react elements
now have a data-reactid attribute that contains a full function definition in
the string.

To be clear, the code below is not particularly interesting or important in
itself, nor is it anything I have created or seen. It is simply what react is
putting into it's react-ids. Here's what a rendered div looks like:

    
    
      <div class="react_row InitiativeFunnelView react_clickable" data-reactid=".0.$function (props, children) {
      var descriptor =0 factory=1apply(this, arguments);
    
      for (var i =0 1; i < arguments=1length; i++) {
        validateChildKeys(arguments[i], descriptor=1type);
      }
    
      var name =0 descriptor=1type=1displayName;
      if (propTypes) {
        checkPropTypes(
          name,
          propTypes,
          descriptor=1props,
          ReactPropTypeLocations=1prop
        );
      }
      if (contextTypes) {
        checkPropTypes(
          name,
          contextTypes,
          descriptor=1_context,
          ReactPropTypeLocations=1context
        );
      }
      return descriptor;
    }.$188.$funnel">
    

This makes reading/debugging HTML output incredibly painful.

What is causing this?
