25524383 Message not fully read (request) for [0] and action [], resetting
Exeception in Elasticsearch

I have configure Elasticsearch in 3 node on different sever. After restarting
elasticsearch nodes, In one elasticsearch node getting Exception `Message not
fully read (request) for [0] and action [], resetting`.

Does anyone face similar issue?  
My ES version is `1.3.0`  
JVM version is `1.7.0_65`

Most likely you're having a client somewhere that has a different version.
When the client and the elasticsearch server have different versions, this
happens. Try to use a little tcpdump and find out! :)
