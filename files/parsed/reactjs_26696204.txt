26696204 Does React.js require server side?

All React.js introductions seem to suggest that React uses a server to create
virtual DOMs and sends diff operations over to client, but I just tried out
the [flux-todomvc](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-
todomvc/) which it didn't need a server at all. What's going on? Is the
"server side" work done inside web worker thread?

React.js does not use a web server to create virtual DOMs. It builds the
virtual DOM and does its diff operations on the client's browser.

  * People mostly use React.js to implement front-end Views (MVC View) of their web applications.
  * But you can use Node.js to render them on the server side if you like (for seo purposes etc.)
