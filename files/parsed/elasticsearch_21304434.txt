21304434 Elasticsearch list all rivers

  
How do I list all the rivers in Elasticsearch, I'm new to it and was adding
rivers on the fly and I want to do some cleaning. The [official
documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/rivers/current/index.html)
doesn't mention a way to do so..

I think this will do the trick for you, as `_river` is an index like any other
it can be queried like one. -

    
    
    curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_river/_search?q=*
    

To piggyback on Nate's answer, if you throw the following line into a browser,
you will get output that's actually readable (notice the "pretty" parameter
was added):

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/_river/_search?q=*&pretty
