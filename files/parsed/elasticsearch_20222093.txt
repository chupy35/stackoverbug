20222093 elasticsearch listen to multiple ips

Is it possible to listen to multiple host adresses so that I can listen to
localhost requests AND private IP requests?

something like:

    
    
    network.host: "127.0.0.1", "192.168.1.4"
    

In fact yes it is. Use the JSON notation.

This is what I used in my configuration: `network.bind_host: ["yourhost",
"localhost"]` and `network.publish_host: yourhost` as you don't want to send
multicast packets on the loopback interface.

I tested the given solution and it did not work. I concluded that Elastic
cannot listen on _specific_ interfaces using `network.bind_host` in the
configuration.

However you **can** tell elastic to listen on _all_ interfaces by specifying:

    
    
    network.bind_host: 0.0.0.0
    network.publish_host: <your external address>
    

This will make sure one address is published (to the cluster) but all
addresses are accessible. Tested and verified with Elastic 2.1.1.
