28034464 React-router: Uncaught ReferenceError: ReactRoute is not defined

I'm following [React Router Guide](https://github.com/rackt/react-
router/blob/master/docs/guides/overview.md) but I'm not even getting to make
the simplest example to work. It says `Uncaught ReferenceError: Route is not
defined`.

I'm including these 3 JavaScript files through `cdnjs` and my own script:

    
    
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.12.2/react.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.12.2/JSXTransformer.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-router/0.11.6/react-router.js"></script>
    
    <script type="text/jsx" src="react/routing/routes.jsx"></script>
    

And the script the triggers the exception is `routes.jsx`:

    
    
    var routes = (
       <Route name="app" path="/" handler={App}>
           <DefaultRoute handler={MainPage}/>
        </Route>
    );
    

Am I missing anything? Have `Route` been renamed?

It's `ReactRouter.Route`.

You can open the console and see the various properties of objects.

Also, take a look at [the exports](https://github.com/rackt/react-
router/blob/master/index.js). In the browser exports becomes ReactRouter, in
commonjs it's the return value of `require('react-router')`.
