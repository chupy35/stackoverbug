21884365 Install elasticsearch mapper attachment plugin

If I want to install elasticsearch-mapper-attachment plugin
`$ES_HOME$\elasticsearch-1.0.0\bin\plugin.bat -install
elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/2.0.0.RC1` should I install
Apache Tika before or comes Tika with the ElasticSearch installation?

The plugin should include Tika already. All you need to do is to upload a
document's base64 encoded attachment using the curl API.
