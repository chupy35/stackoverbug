24202702 Elasticsearch: Alias pointing to an alias

I am using ES aliases for decoupling index names with the application using ES

    
    
    ALIAS NAME      INDEX NAME
    
    user_index    - user
    project_index - project
    org_index     - org
    

Now I need another alias pointing to all the three aliases, to maintain one
single point of search (for supporting existing APIs)

Can I have another alias pointing to all the three aliases here? Something
like.

    
    
    main_index __ user_index
               \__ project_index 
                \__ org_index
    

No, unfortunately, this capability does not yet exist in Elasticsearch.

There is an outstanding issue requesting this capability. Please see
[Elasticsearch Issue
#3138](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3138) for more
details related to the requested functionality. Please note that this
particular issue has been open for over a year, but there has not been any
comment from anyone on the Elasticsearch development team. Therefore, I am not
sure how long it will be until this capability is implemented within
Elasticsearch.

No, but you can have as many aliases as you want on your index. So, you can
set an other alias "main_index" directly on your three index.  Wouldn't that
be enough to suit your needs?
