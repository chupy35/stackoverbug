12917691 Elastic search, unique query result

Imagine the following data :

    
    
    data: [
      {  A: 1
         B: 1
         C: 1
      }
      {  A: 1
         B: 1
         C: 2
      }
      {  A: 3
         B: 1
         C: 23
      }
      ... 
    ]
    

When I query, I would like to receive every data that has its value B as 1,
but I don't want them to share the same A value. In other words I would like
my query result to contain unique A values. So in this example I would have
either C = 2, 23 or C = 1, 23. Is this achievable in elastic search ?

After a long research, I have learned that, there is no way to achieve this as
of now. Elastic search does not support such an operation.
