16781484 ElasticSearch mass delete by URL

I have about 8 million documents(with URL) in the ElasticSearch(v.0.90) index
but only 3,5 millions documents are "valid"(need to be searched within). I
have a list of all "valid" URLs(no special template here).

How can I delete other 4,5M documents from the index?

You can use [DeleteByQuery
API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/delete-by-query/). Then,
you will probably need to run
[Optimize](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-indices-
optimize/).

But you will need for that a lot of free disk space.
