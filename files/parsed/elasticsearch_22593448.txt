22593448 2D search radius in elasticsearch

I've been looking into elasticsearch for a new project but i've noticed that
the geo search seems exclusively for finding things on a sphere.

Is there a way to search within a radius on a 2d plane rather than 3d, I've
seen that you can search using the planar option but that is still assuming a
lat and log, i want to do the same thing with x and y only.

For example mongodb supports this
