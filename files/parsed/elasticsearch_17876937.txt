17876937 Elasticsearch query does not give back id (but all other data)

I'm quite new to ElasticSearch, and I've written (to be more precise
generated) a simple query to retrieve saved data created by a certain user.

The query gives back right results, my problem is that the `id` and/or the
`_id` field is missing from the result. All other fields are retrieved
perferctly, the condition is okay too.

Can you suggest me, how to include the ˙id˙ field to the result? Here is the
query:

    
    
    {
      'filter': {
        'limit': {'value': 100}
      }, 
      'query': {
        'bool': {
          'should': [
            {'term': {'user': 'acct:test_user@0.0.0.0:5000'}}
          ], 
          'minimum_number_should_match': 1
        }
      }
    }
    

(I know I can write the query simpler but it is designed that other terms will
be added to it) The user field's definition is simple too:

    
    
    'user': {'type': 'string', 'index': 'not_analyzed'}
    

Thanks for the help. I'm aware that this is may be a rookie question, but I
just can't get it right.

Just to make sure you know, `_id` is not part of the document body like other
fields. Unless you duplicate `_id` in the document, you won't see it in the
`_source` part of a result.

You will get `_id` returned, but not "in the same place" as the other fields,
that is not in the `_source`, it is one level higher.
