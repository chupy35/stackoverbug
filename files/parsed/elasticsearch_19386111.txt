19386111 Elasticsearch shard crashing

I am having an issue with one of my elasticsearch shards crashing and
restarting the node does not fix the issue. I have a machine dedicated to
elasticsearch that has 16GB of RAM with a 8GB heap size. I am running only one
node with 2 shards and no replicas. The cluster stats list that we have
741,189 documents and 1.2GB of data, we had 2.5GB before the shard crashed.

I have a very insert, update, and retrieval heavy application and about the
time we reach 2.5GB of data and 1,000,000 documents one of the shards crashes
and can not be restarted. The only way that I have found to fix the issue I am
having to to delete all of the data and reindex the node. The shard crash
about every 3 to 4 days now and the rate in which data is being added to the
system is expected to increase over time. I am happy to provide any other
information that may be helpful in fixing this issue.
