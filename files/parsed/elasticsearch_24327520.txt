What are the differences and similarities between fieldquery and termquery

    
    
        FilterBuilders.queryFilter(QueryBuilders.fieldQuery("truckName", "joshi"));
        FilterBuilders.queryFilter(QueryBuilders.termQuery("truckName", "joshi"));
    

Both returning same results. Please give an examples

A term query is looking for an exact match of a terms field without doing any
analysis of the parameter.

It looks like the fieldQuery (from
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/0.90/query-dsl-
field-query.html>) is a simple form of query_string on a specific field, so it
would be doing analysis.

The two would act the same for single word "truckName", but the termQuery
would be faster.
