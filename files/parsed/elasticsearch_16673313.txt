16673313 Matching author and title with elasticsearch

I'm trying to match books based on an author and title. Unfortunately titles
and authors used as input differ from those in elasticsearch, the words are in
different orders and have other differences so I can't do exact matching. My
book records have a field author and title. I've come up with the following
query:

    
    
    {
      "query":{
        "bool":{
          "must":{
            "query_string":{
              "query":"Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me"
            },
            "fuzzy":{
              "author":{
                "value":"Peka, Harvey",
                "boost":2
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "from":1,
      "size":1
    }
    

It's giving the same result every time no matter what the input so it seems
like there's a problem with it. Am I going about it the wrong way?

I indexed some books and authors and tried this out. Worked for me for
different combinatios, like, jumbled words and incomplete names and even when
some words were incorrect, as shown below:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "query_string": {
                "default_field": "book",
                "query": "The girl with the angel tattoo"
              }
            },
            {
              "query_string": {
                "default_field": "author",
                "query": "Steig Larsson"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
