22366606 ElasticSearch - specifying an exact port (no port range)

I want to specify an exact port for ElasticSearch to use for HTTP traffic. How
can I do so? In the config file, it says it listens to a port range by
default. How can I restrict this port range to just 1 port?

    
    
    Elasticsearch, by default, binds itself to the 0.0.0.0 address, and listens
    on port [9200-9300] for HTTP traffic and on port [9300-9400] for node-to-node
    communication. (the range means that if the port is busy, it will automatically
    try the next port).
    

In config folder.. There is an file called "elasticsearch.Yml". In that
Parameters for port are commented.. Just remove hash before http.port and add
port value to it..

    
    
        http.port : 5000
    

You can do this for both tcp and http
