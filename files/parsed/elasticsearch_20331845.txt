20331845 How to query all fields individually with ElasticSearch

As I understand it, ElasticSearch searches on the magic _all field by default.
The problem with this seems to be that if a field uses a different index
analyzer, the analyzed data from this field is not searched.

I've had success with searching on the fields ['domain', '_all'] but I really
need to avoid having to manually specify each field which was analyzed
differently. I see fields supports wildcards but seemingly not ' _' on its
own. I could do a_ , b*, c*, d* etc. but this seems a tad inefficient.
