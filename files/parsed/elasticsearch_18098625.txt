18098625 elasticsearch, document disappear in search after update of size less
than 17

**SOLVED** Upgraded elasticsearch to 0.90.3

Good day, I have a problem with elasticsearch.

  1. I have a page with list of items (ordered by itemName)

  2. Goes to edit item and update item's Name
    
        ejs.Document(index, type, item_id).source($scope.master).doUpdate(); 
    (elastic.js - It's doesn't matter I guess, it's works )
    

It's updated successfully - I have update document with version 2, and updated
fields.

  3. Go back to list of items, my query
    
        {
     "from": 0,
     "size": 10,
     "sort": [
     "itemName"
     ],
     "version": true
    }
    

And updated item - disappeared in list

My list:

    
    
    1. Old name a
    2. Old name b
    3. Old name c
    N. ...
    

I change "Old name b" to "Old name b 2"

And I get if "size": 10 :

    
    
    1. Old name a
    2. Old name c
    3. next item ...
    N. ...
    

But if I set "size": 20 or more - appeared.

    
    
    1. Old name a
    2. Old name b 2
    3. Old name c
    4. nex item ...
    N. ...
    

**So why updated items disappeared in list if size < 20 ?**

Elasticsearch version: 0.90.0
