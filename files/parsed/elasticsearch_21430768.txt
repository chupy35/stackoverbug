21430768 While creating an aliases in elasticsearch

I'm new to elastic search. Now I've created aliases for 2 index. What is the
internal process of elsasticsearch? will it create seperate or it will refer
existing index.Seperate index means, will it occupy extra space?

    
    
     i ve 2 index "index1" and "index2". now i create "indexaliasis" as a aliasis for index1  
     and index2.Now, will the elastic search create new index called in name "indexaliasis" and      
     occupy seperate space, or it ll jus refer two index and search.
    

i am asking because we can have filters in aliasis. when will that filter
applied. during search or while creating aliasis.

Thanks in advance..!

Alias does not create another index. It's just a mapping.
