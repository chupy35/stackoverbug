21105239 Elasticsearch HTTP River

I'm starting to play around with Elasticsearch, and I'd like to periodically
pull data via HTTP from a particular location, ideally as a river, every few
seconds or so.

The particular address is a simple monitoring endpoint, and outputs some JSON
about the state of it's systems. Doesn't need any authentication, just the
HTTP request.

Is there a recommended way of doing this inside ES? Or, should I just put
together a polling server that pull and pushes?
