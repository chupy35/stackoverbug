22306484 Why does ElasticSearch give a lower score to a term when it's with
more terms?

I have an index (on a local, testing, cluster), with some fields using the
simple analizer.

When I search for a term, the results where the term is in a field with more
terms, get a lower score - why is that? I couldn't find any reference.

For example, 'koala' in a boolean search returns:

  * (title 'a koala'): score 0.04500804
  * (title 'how the Koala 1234'): score 0.02250402

In the query explanation, the fieldNorm is 1.0 in the first case, and 0.5 in
the second.

Is it possible to return a score indipendent from the number of terms in the
field?

To return a bool must term query of koala with all documents scoring equal on
"koala". You could use the constant score query to basically remove the score
from your query.

Here is a runnable example
