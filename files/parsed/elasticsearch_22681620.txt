22681620 Is there anyway to create alias on query search?

I want to create an alias on top of this. Index - test, Type - type

    
    
    POST /test/type/_search
    {
        "query": {
        "match": {
            "brand_name": "xyz"
            }
       }    
    }
    

But I don't see anyway of doing it,since Elasticsearch aliases can only be
created on filters and when I try with term filter,I don't get the results
which I want.Any trick to achieve this ?

You can use a [query
filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-query-filter.html) to use any query as a filter:

    
    
    "filter" : {
      "query" : {
        "match" : {
          "brand_name" : "xyz"
        }
      }
    }
