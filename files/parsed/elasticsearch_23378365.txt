23378365 List all fields in an elasticsearch index?

How do I get a list of all the fields that are present in an index (i.e.
fields that occur in indexed documents, not just in the mapping)?

**Explanation:**

Don't think there is any way to do exactly that. But since everything in the
index automatically gets thrown in the mapping, we know that the mapping
contains at least every field in the index. From there, you can loop through
each field in the mapping and run a count on the number of results in the
index that have that field. If the count is more than 0, then that field
exists; if the count is 0, then that field is not part of the index. Since we
know that every field in the index will exist in your mapping, this should
cover all possibilities.

**Some example API calls:**

    
    
    # Get the mapping
    $ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/index/type/_mapping?pretty'
    
    # Count a field
    $ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/index/type/_count' -d '
    {
        "query" : {
            "constant_score" : {
                "filter" : {
                    "exists" : { "field" : "name_from_mapping" }
                }
            }
        }
    }'
    

**Documentation:**

  * [`GET` mapping](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-get-mapping.html)
  * [count API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-count.html)
  * [exists filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-exists-filter.html)

I might consider creating an "elasticsearch-index-fieldlist" plugin, similar
to <https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-index-termlist>, if there is
really no straightforward way to get at the list of fields present in an
index...

Starting with 1.3 you have the
[_field_names](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/mapping-
field-names-field.html) meta field.

    
    
    {
      "aggs": {
        "Field names": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "_field_names", 
            "size": 10
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

In current(5.2) version, you can use the mapping API to get all the field
names:

    
    
    GET index_name/_mapping?pretty
