23771600 What is the maximum size of an array in elasticsearch

What would be the maximum recommended size for an array field in an
elasticsearch document? I am looking into using a document field in order to
keep a list of the IDs of "followers" of a user, in order to boost the
document in the query results when the user executing the query is following a
potential match.

Also, is there perhaps a better way to improve the relevance of a user
document than this rather brutal approach?
