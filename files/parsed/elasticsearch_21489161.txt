21489161 "last seen time" for a term in elasticsearch

I have a mapping that has a host and a timestamp (among other fields), and
would like to get a "last seen time" for some number of recently seen hosts.
Is there a better way to do this than to first do a term facet on the host
field, then a range query (limit=1) on each of the term values sorted in
descending order?

A term stats facet would bring back the min/max for the timestamp for each
host wouldn't it?

    
    
    {
        "query" : {
            "match_all" : {  }
        },
        "facets" : {
            "host_time_stats" : {
                "terms_stats" : {
                    "key_field" : "host",
                    "value_field" : "timestamp"
                }
            }
        }
    }
