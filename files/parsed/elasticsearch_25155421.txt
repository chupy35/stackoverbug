25155421 How to sort fields in _source for a search?

I have a requirement where we are creating CSV from the search result of a
particular query. The problem statement is:

There are certain questions with values stored in the elasticsearch. For
example A with value of 1 or 0. B with Value of 1 and 0 and so on. Now when I
retrieve the response, the questions(fields) in _search are not in order for
example it comes as A,C,D,F,B. What we want is something to be added to query
so that we have a sorted field list in_source such as A,B,C,D so that it can
directly be mapped into CSV. Does elasticsearch provide any API of this sort?
