23248359 ElasticSearch mapping dates

First time using ElasticSearch, I'm having trouble indexing a document due to
the mapping of dates.

in my DB dates are `DATETIME` and look like this `2014-02-04 14:04:39`. I'm
trying to parse this in ElasticSearch but it's telling me that

`[Invalid format: \"2014-02-04 14:04:39\" is malformed at \" 14:04:39\"]`

I've tried setting the format quite a few different ways:

    
    
    'date_added' => array(
            'type' => 'date',
            'format' => 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'
            )
    

and also like this:

`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`

`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZZ`

What is the correct format for this?

In mapping, configure the field to date and also the format you need.. For
syntax refer

core-types.html#date>

The date format that are supported by elasticsearch refer the following link..
