24841519 Elasticsearch: Operation AND then OR for Query String Function

In Elasticsaerch, I am trying to implement operator AND and OR at the same
time whereby results with AND is/are **ranked higher** than those of OR.

For example, if I search for "buy fruit". I want the result with:

  1. "buy fruit" or "buy...fruit" (order of "buy" and "fruit" doesn't matter) to come up  
first, then follow by

  2. "buy" or "fruit" (order of "buy" or "fruit" doesn't matter)

Sorry in advance if someone has already answered this type of issue before. I
have been trying to find an answer for this issue but I can't find a solution.

What you are asking is the default behaviour of elasticsearch. If more terms
match, you get a higher _score.
