29991192 Spring Boot says that JPA doesn't support custom isolation levels,
but it seems like spring can do it

In spring boot's BasicBatchConfigurer there is a warning presented:

logger.warn("JPA does not support custom isolation levels, so locks may not be
taken when launching Jobs");

However, I get the impression that this issue has been addressed:
<https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-11942>

Is there a work around for this issue? Should I just be extending
BatchConfigurer and implementing my own createJobRepository method? Should
there be a change to spring boot code?
