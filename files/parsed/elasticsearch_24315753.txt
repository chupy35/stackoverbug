24315753 elasticsearch - querying multiple indexes is possible?

I have an elasticsearch cluster with 3 indexes:

    
    
    /users/user
    /events/visit
    /events/register
    /pages/page
    

So, now I need to run queries processing multiple indexes.

Eg: **Get gender of users registered in page X.** ( _To get this info, I need
infos from multiple indexes._ )

Is this possible? Maybe integrating hadoop?

This is quite easy within Elasticsearch itself! Anytime you would specify an
index, you can separate additional indices by comma.

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/index1,index2/_search?q=yourQueryHere'
    

You can also search all indices with _all.

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_all/_search?q=yourQueryHere'
    

Here's some helpful documentation from elasticsearch's website. This site has
TONS of info, but it is a bit difficult to find sometimes, IMO.

index.html>

By not limiting our search to a particular index or type, we have searched
across all documents in the cluster. Elasticsearch forwarded the search
request in parallel to a primary or replica of every shard in the cluster.

    
    
           1)/users,events,pages/_search : Search all types in the users,events and pages
    
           2)/u*,e*,p*/_search : Search all types in any indices beginning with u,e or beginning with p
    
           3)/events/visit,register/_search : Search types visit and register in the events index
    
           4) /_all/user,visit,register,page/_search : Search types users,events and pages in specified indices
    

It is possible to do search query through multiple indices:

for example:

    
    
    curl -X POST \
    'http://localhost:9200/test1,test2/_search?pretty=' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
        "query": {
        ...
        }
    }
    '
