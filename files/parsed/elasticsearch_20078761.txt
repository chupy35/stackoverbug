20078761 Multiple types in Elasticsearch Type Filter

I have a filtered query like this

    
    
    query: {
      filtered: {
        query: {
          bool: {
            should: [{multi_match: {
                        query: @query,
                        fields: ['title', 'content']
                        }
                      },{fuzzy: {
                         content: {
                           value: @query,
                           min_similarity: '1d',
                           }
                     }}]
                   }
                 },
        filter: {
          and: [
             type: {
                value: @type
              }]
        }}}
    

That works fine if @type is a string, but does not work if @type is an array.
How can I search for multiple types?

This worked, but I'm not happy with it:

    
    
    filter: {
      or: [
        { type: { value: 'blog'} },
        { type: { value: 'category'} },
        { type: { value: 'miscellaneous'} }
      ]
    }
    

I'd love to accept a better answer

You can easily specify multiple types in your search request's URL, e.g.
`http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet,user/_search`, or with `type` in the
header if using `_msearch`, as [documented
here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
search.html#search-multi-index-type).

These are then added as filters for you by Elasticsearch.

Also, you usually want to be using `bool` to combine filters, for reasons
described in this article: [all about elasticsearch filter
bitsets](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/all-about-elasticsearch-filter-
bitsets/)
