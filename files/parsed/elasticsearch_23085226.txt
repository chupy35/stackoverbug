23085226 ElasticSearch AngularJS Client - when i include space in search
result is not correct

I am new to ElasticSearch.I found that when I search with "2" it gives
following record but when I search "2 liter" it gives empty result. It seems
that ElasticSearch Server is not considering space between words.

_suso orange quality flavour in 2 liter can ERP2_

Can anybody please help me that what I need to change ?

Thank You.

**One Field in my indexed JSON**

Product Detail : suso orange quality flavour in 2 liter can ERP2

**ElasticSearch AngularJS Client code.**

    
    
    EsConnector.controller('QueryController', function($scope, es) {
     $scope.change = function() {
    console.log($scope.searchProduct);
    
    // search for documents
        es.search({
        index: 'test_index',
        size: 50,
        body: {
        "query":
            {
                "regexp": {
    
                   "productDetail":$scope.searchProduct+".*",
                } ,
                "analyzer": "whitespace"
            },
        }
    
        }).then(function (response) {
          $scope.hits = response.hits.hits;
        });
    }
    });
    

  1. You could use simple query string request, not regexp; change query to $scope.searchProduct+"*".
  2. "Whitespace analyzer" breaks your query into terms on whitespace - it means, elasticsearch will look up documents with terms "suso" and "orange" for query string "suso orange".
  3. Another important thing you didn't mention is index analyzer; it's the setting which tells elasticsearch how to break your document fields on terms it woll later be searching and how to "preprocess" them - for instance, lowercase or change one symbols to another.
