16913073 define analyzer globally (ES)

I need/want to define my custom analyzers globally. therefore I edited the
configuration file of ES (elasticsearch.yml) according to this answer: [Can I
customize Elastic Search to use my own Stop Word
list?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4927629/can-i-customize-elastic-
search-to-use-my-own-stop-word-list/13012458#13012458) the relevant entries
are

    
    
    index.analysis.analyzer.angram:
      type: custom
      tokenizer: standard
      filter: standard, lowercase, fngram
    index.analysis.filter.fngram:
      type: nGram
      min_gram: 2
      max_gram: 10
    

but when I try to invoke `curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_analyze?analyzer=angram'
-d 'this is a test'` I get an `ElasticSearchIllegalARgumentException[failed to
find analyzer [angram]]`.

is the configuration wrong? (although I'd expect ES to not start-up when
encountered an error when reading the configuration during start-up)

how do I correctly define an analyzer globally?

**EDIT:** I'm using version 0.90.0

The problem was with the URL in the `curl` statement. credit goes to Ivan (

I'm quoting his answer from the group:

> You cannot use a custom analyzer until it is referenced by an index. You
would need to create a mapping that uses the analyzer and then use that index
in the analyzer call. There is no need to index any documents to that index.
