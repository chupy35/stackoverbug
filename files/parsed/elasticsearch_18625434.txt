18625434 ElasticSearch: delete shard

I have my index distributed by customer: 1 customer <-> 1 shard

When customer is deleted I want to delete the whole shard related to
corresponding customer and will be excellent if I can do this repdily. Is it
possible to delete whole shard directly? Are there are any alternatives to
delete large amount of data from elasticsearch?

The customer might have some thing in common an id or something...You can use
the delete by query api to do the same based on the id criteria.

Please have a look at the following link:

<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/0.90/docs-delete-by-
query.html>

Using this you can delete all docs which has a common id (in your case it can
be customer id) in the index.

I hope the id is indexed as well.
