14865360 Is it possible in ElasticSearch to have a _parent mapping that is of
the same type as the child?

Basically, is it possible to do this?

    
    
    curl -XPOST http://esdev1-sn1:9200/test/tracking/_mapping -d '
    {
      "tracking": {
        "_parent": {
          "type": "tracking"
        }
      }
    }
    '
    

Theoretically, nothing prevents you from doing this. Practically, figuring out
routing might be an issue. Elasticsearch requires all children to be indexed
in the same shard as parent. So, in your case if your index contains more than
one shard then for any given document all its ancestors and descendants have
to be indexed with the same `_routing` value.
