24435888 elasticsearch: find the newest elements, return "asc"

Using Elasticsearch in Go, I need to search for the newest last X elements,
ordered by time.

I think having something like this will accomplish the goal:

    
    
    "query": {"constant_score": {}},
    "sort": {"time": {"order": "desc"}},
    "size": X
    

However, this would return the newest elements in reverse order, wouldn't it?

Is there a way to return the newest X elements in ascending order?

This request will give you the oldest elements matching the query.

To achieve your goal, you could make a count query (ordering not needed) and
then a desc sorted request with the start parameter set to count-X. This
solution is ugly and very inefficient.

You'd be a lot better off desc sorting the results in your Go app.
