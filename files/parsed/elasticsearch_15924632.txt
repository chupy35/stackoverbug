15924632 Empty string in Elasticsearch date field?

I have a date field setup in my mapping like this:

    
    
    "groupsAssignedDate" : {
        "type" : "date",
        "format" : "MM-dd-YYYY"
    }
    

In my app, the field groupsAssignedDate is set to the empty string initially.
When a group is assigned, a unix timestamp is generated and stored in the
field. I'm trying to use elasticsearch's bulk update function to bring in a
bunch of documents with a groupsAssignedDate of "" because no groups have been
assigned yet. Elasticsearch won't index the docs though. This is in the log
file:

    
    
    Failed to parse [groupsAssignedDate]
    ...
    failed to parse date field [], tried both date format [MM-dd-YYYY], and timestamp number
    

It appears elasticsearch supports the JSON null value...do I need to switch my
docs from using "" to null or is there some way I can support using the empty
string instead?

Sounds like you may have answered this yourself. Just using null rather than
"" in the date field should work.

If that's an issue, maybe consider this from  
<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ignore-
malformed.html#ignore-malformed-setting>

The **index.mapping.ignore_malformed** global setting can be set on the index
level to allow to ignore malformed content globally across all mapping types
(malformed content example is trying to index a string value as a numeric
type).
