15336990 elasticsearch - Should I organize the data all in one table?

I'm new to ElasticSearch and search in general.

I've a large database that I need to search. 70 tables.

I don't know very well which the best practices for searching a database like
this. I've done a large SQL select to 25 database tables to have all the data
that I need. I mainly have done this because I will need Facets.

This makes any sense in ElasticSearch? How is the best way to organize the
data to be searched in ElasticSearch?

Best Regards,

A notable feature of ElasticSearch is the ability to search across multiple
Indices/Types or both, this will allow you to structure your data in a similar
way as it was structured in the database.

An Indices is essentially ElasticSearch' equivalent to a Database and a Type
is that to a table. This allows you to keep the data separated, so for
instance having a ElasticSearch definition like so -

    
    
    Index  |  Type
    
    data   -  table1
    data   -  table2
    data   -  table3
    data   -  ....
    

This would allow you to search across all of your types in one query, like so
-

    
    
    curl -XPUT <host>:9200/data/table1,table2,table3
    

Or you could have different indexes with the same type, like so -

    
    
    Index  |  Type
    
    data1   -  table
    data2   -  table
    data3   -  table
    data4   -  ....
    

This ability to logically separate your data is a powerful feature of
ElasticSearch, dividing the data amongst indices or types also keeps
performance in mind.
