18722916 Elasticsearch how to index text files using the command line

I started playing with Elasticsearch. I want to create index for a textfile. I
mean that I have multiple text files in a folder. I want to create index on
these text files so that I can perform text search on these files. Is there a
way to do this using command line or . Please guide me with an example.

yes, you can by using the FS river + mapper attachment plugin. [Here is a
link](https://github.com/dadoonet/fsriver) to the source page.

I ran a few tests with it a little while ago. It works fine. Be aware though,
that the file has to be local for this to work (even if you can mount a remote
file to a local path).

Hope this helps.
