28923117 React tools to transform JSX does nothing

When I run the react-tools to transform jsx to js, nothing happens - what am I
missing? There are no errors either

    
    
    F:\>jsx -x jsx "path to jsx scripts" "path to build folder"
    

There was a backslash at the end of the path that was apparently causing the
issue. It would be nice it jsx told you that it could not find the path
instead of just being silent
