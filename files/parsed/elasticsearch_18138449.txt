18138449 Migrating large user to its own index in ElasticSearch

In Shay's Berlin Buzzwords talk, in the "user data flow" portion, he talked
about "very large users can be migrated to their own respective indices". Is
this said migration a out-of-the-box supported operation with no user-visible
disruption, or is it a custom migration that we'll have to implement
ourselves?

As Mike W said, we need more information to give you a better answer.

But I think you are trying to migrate that specific user to his own index. If
so, we should be using the alias feature elaticsearch gives you out-of-the-
box. You can read more of it at this link

I believe you need a mapping to support your idea. Mapping each user to the
corresponding index, so very large users will go to their own index and others
not so large can share the same index.
