24614088 Spring Boot - Select service implemenation via command line

Is it possible to select what service implementation to use via a command line
option or value in the application.properties files (ideally with a default).
Does that solution works with `@EnableAutoConfiguration`?

My use case is the following: I have an application that has 3 service
implementations, and depending on the environment I would like to select one
or the other.

Currently only one of the implementations is marked with `@Service`, as
otherwise `@EnableAutoConfiguration` does not work.

Maybe you can use [Spring
profiles](https://spring.io/blog/2011/02/14/spring-3-1-m1-introducing-
profile/). Mark each `@Bean` implementation with `@Profile("...")` and then
start your app with `spring.profiles.active=...` to select the beans you need.
