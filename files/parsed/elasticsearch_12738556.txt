12738556 Can I set a TTL for an ElasticSearch index?

I can set a ttl for a type in the template but can I set a ttl for the entire
index? Hmm... I could test this with some guess and check. I'll get around to
that and post the answer if I find one.

There's no way internal to ES to automate index deletion. You'll have to
handle that through the API with your client.
