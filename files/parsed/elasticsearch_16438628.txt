16438628 How to alter ElasticSearch Field name

My ElasticSearch mapping created

    
    
    curl -XPUT 'http://myhostname:9200/data/my_data/_mapping' -d '
    {
        "my_data" : {
            "properties" : {
                    "empID" : {"type" : "integer"},
                    "empName" : {"type" : "string"}
            }
        }
    }'
    

so, i want to alter fieldname 'empName' to 'Emp_Name'.whether it is
possible,and also i had data existing for this mapping.

Sorry, I don't think you can alter field names. You'll have to delete your
index, create the mapping with the name you want, and re-index your data if
possible.
