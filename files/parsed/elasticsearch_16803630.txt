16803630 Multiple core type mappings for the same field in elasticsearch (e.g.
string and object)

Is it possible to create multiple core type mappings for a single field e.g. a
field Qty which allows both long/string values or a field which allows both
object/string values?

I'm using the mongodb river and once the field is indexed as an object, it
throws a MapperParsingException for all other data that contain this field as
a string?

I read here <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/1166> that
this is not possible, does it still hold true?  I'm using v 0.19.8.

I've also tried setting ignore_conflicts : true in my mapping as per the
example shown <http://grokbase.com/t/gg/elasticsearch/128ath8kh1/some-mapping-
confusions-to-resolve>, but the data I was looking for was not pulled into
elasticsearch from mongodb.

I also took a look at <http://elasticsearch-
users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Getting-MapperParsingException-while-parsing-a-
string-and-a-number-td3897986.html>, but I dont have control over the schema
(can't rename the field differently if different types are encountered)

I'd like to make sure that elasticsearch has all the documents that I have
stored in mongodb. Thanks!

No, but you might want to see if you can leverage the [multifield
type](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/multi-field-type/)
to get where you're trying to go
