14934328 ElasticSearch: how to define custom analyzers with REST API?

I want to define custom analyzers through the REST API (I'm using a hosted
service - <http://searchbox.io> ), but I can't understand how to do it.

I'm trying to create a PUT request to /myindex/_settings with the following:

    
    
       index: {
                analysis: {
                        analyzer: {
                                "my_analyzer": {
                                        type: "snowball",
                                        language: "English"
                                }
                        }
                }
        }
    

but it doesn't work, if I index a field with "my_analyzer" set as the analyzer
I'm getting an error that it doesn't exist..

I found the answer - those settings must be set when creating the index.

so a POST request to /myindex did it.
