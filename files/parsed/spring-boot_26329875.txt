26329875 Spring Boot and Jackson, JSR310 in response body

The JacksonAutoConfiguration initializes an ObjectMapper with the JSR310Module
registered. Then HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration initializes a
MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter. But this MessageConverter never gets
plugged in the RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessor.

As a result:

  * If the controller returns a object which should be jsonified by Jackson, dates are poorly converted because the wrong MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter is used (initialized in WebMvcConfigurationSupport#addDefaultHttpMessageConverters)
  * But, if the ObjectMapper is injected in the controller and used to jsonify the same object, then the date format is alright.

How can I can wake the WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter up? What should I do to
bind the configured Jackson ObjectMapper with Spring MVC and make it handle
response bodies?

If you use `@EnableWebMvc` that would explain your symptoms So the rule thumb
is: do not use `@EnableWebMvc` with Spring Boot, unless you wan't to customize
Web MVC configuration?
