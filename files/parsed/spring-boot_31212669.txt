31212669 How to store request parameter in cache

I want to store my request in cache for the future reference because my method
is void. I don't know how. My methods syntax is:

    
    
    @CacheEvict(key="Key",value="AirSegment",beforeInvocation=true)
        private void cahingAndStoringSegment(String Key,TypeBaseAirSegment AirSegment){
        --- doing some operation
    }
    

I am new in spring boot so please help me out.

It isn't clear what you are trying to do. Usually you use the @Cacheable
attribute to prevent your method from going to a slow backend resource on each
invocation. The @Cacheable annotation uses all the method arguments as the
key. However since your operation is void its unclear what you are trying to
cache.

@CacheEvict is used when you want invocation of a method to clear the cache.

There is also the @CachePut tag. @CachePut(value=AirSegment,key=key) would add
the the passed AirSegment in your operation to the cache.

<http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-
reference/html/cache.html#cache-annotations-cacheable>

If you think of a CRUD operation, the @Cachable would be used on the Read
operations, and the @CacheEvict on the Create, Update and Delete operations.
