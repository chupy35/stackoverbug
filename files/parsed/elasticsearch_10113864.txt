10113864 Different boost values for different indexes

Using ElasticSearch, I run queries across several indexes. But I want the
results coming from different indexes to have different weights (~ different
"boost factor" in ES parlance, I think).

The goal is to tweak the ranking of query results, on a per-index **and** per-
query basis. I want a soft preference of results from chosen indexes, not a
hard yes/no filter on indexes.

Example:

    
    
    Query results, 3 hits:
    
    1. doc A, from index Z, score 0.7
    2. doc B, from index Y, score 0.6
    3. doc C, from index Y, score 0.65
    

I want to boost all results from index Y (docs B and C) so they get a higher
score. Different queries require different index weights. How do I do that in
the query DSL syntax?

Never mind, found out that ES supports that out of the box:
