28627800 How to make an easily embeddable React component that displays any
other component's state when used as its child?

I'd like to make a React component that, when inserted inside any other
component, will display its state in a DIV floated to the right of the screen.
Let name it `StateExplorer`.

Because many `StateExplorers` can be used on the same page, the DIVs will
stack with the same `z-index`.

The challenge here is to make `StateExplorer` easily non-verbosely embeddable,
like this:

    
    
    <SomeComponent>
        <StateExplorer/>
        ....
    </SomeComponent>
    

The particular issue here is: how do I hook on componentWillUpdate() so that
the StateExplorer always displays up-to-date state? I could use a mixin, but
that throws 2 problems:

  1. `componentWillUpdate()` can be implemented already in the parent component
  2. adding a mixing adds more verbosity; the ideal case is to just add `StateExplorer` and nothing more.

P.S. I know about React Debug Tools, but it's not so convenient in some cases
and adds extra steps before you can see state of a single component.

Sounds like what you need is a **Higher-order component**.  Here is a good
