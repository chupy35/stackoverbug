24996937 Listen for spring boot embedded tomcat failure

If the embedded tomcat instance within spring-boot fails (port already in use
for example). The spring boot application is unaware. The
TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer adds connectors using "StandardSerice" which
just catches the exception and logs it. StandardService is a tomcat class and
so can't be changed within the scope of spring-boot.

Does anyone have a solution to perhaps listen for tomcat lifecycle events to
catch this failure within the spring application and exit?

This is using spring boot 1.1.4. The same behaviour is seen either by
launching the Main class of the application from eclipse or by running the
executable jar built using the spring-boot maven plugin.

You don't say which version of Spring Boot you're using, or how you're running
your application which makes it very hard to provide a definitive answer.

In 1.1.4.RELEASE running with `java -jar`, `gradle bootRun` or `mvn spring-
boot:run` should fail and exit in the event of a port clash. If you're running
your application directly in your IDE then there's a [known
problem](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/1232) that
meant the application wouldn't exit. It's fixed in the latest 1.1.5 snapshots.
