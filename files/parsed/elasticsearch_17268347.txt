If you look at the results it matches the terms in name with pi*, which is
what I expect from the above query.

But how to write a query to sort results with term location(position index) in
the field. The results of that query should make `Piano Tribute Players`,
`Pink Floyd` to pop up on the top of list. Since they begin with pi*
