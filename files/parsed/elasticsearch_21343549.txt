21343549 Can I specify the result fields in elasticsearch query?

In my dataset, a document contains 20+ fields with nested objects. Most of
them are long text fields. These fields are important for full-text search but
we only need to show the title, short-description and Id in output.

Is it possible to specify the output fields in ElasticSearch for a full text
query? (like projection in MongoDB)

I think you're looking for the
[`fields`](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
request-fields.html) property of a search request:

> Allows to selectively load specific fields for each document represented by
a search hit. Defaults to load the internal `_source` field.

>  
>  
>     {

>         "fields" : ["user", "postDate"],

>         "query" : {

>             "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }

>         }

>     }

>  
>

> The fields will automatically load stored fields (store mapping set to yes),
or, if not stored, will load the `_source` and extract it from it (allowing to
return nested document object).

Take care in ElasticSearch 1.0.0.RC1 the fields return values now are always
lists, if need the result to be a long instead of a list of longs (which might
be a single value list for you most of the time) you can limit those with
_source

    
    
    {"_source" : ["field1", "field2", ...],
         "query" : {
            "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }
        }
    }
