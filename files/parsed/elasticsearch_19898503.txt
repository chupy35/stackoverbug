19898503 Elasticsearch not storing field, what am I doing wrong?

I have something like the following template in my Elasticsearch. I just want
certain part of the data returned, so I turn the source off, and explicitly
stated store for the fields I want.

    
    
    {
      "template_1" : {
        "order" : 20,
        "template" : "test*",
        "settings" : { },
        "mappings" : {
          "_default_" : {
            "_source" : {
              "enabled" : false
            }
          },
          "type_1" : {
            "mydata" :
              "store" : "yes",
              "type" : "string"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

However, when I query the data, I don't get the fields back. The query works,
however, if I enable the _source field. I am just starting with Elasticsearch,
so I am not quite sure what I am doing wrong. Any help would be appreciated.

Field definitions should be wrapped in `properties` section of your mapping:

    
    
      "type_1" : {
        "properties": {
          "mydata" :
            "store" : "yes",
            "type" : "string"
          }
        }
      }
