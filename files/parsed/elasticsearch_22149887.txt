22149887 How is the search snippet and meta "description" of a post
determined?

Wen you search in stackoverflow, in most cases a search snippet (first 40
words or so of a post / question) is shown. In some cases, more text is shown
and this text includes the search terms. Both blocks of text are ending with
ellipsis symbol.

If you look at the meta tag "description" or "og:description", a similar text
is included, thus allowing Google to index correctly.

My questions:

  * What search engine is stackoverflow using (elastic search / Lucene) ?

  * How and when is the search snippet determined (in realtime during search action or when saving a post / question ?) 

  * How and when is the meta-description determined.

I ask these questions because I want to prevent that I start coding an
algorithm to determine the first 40 words or so of an html article (in our
case a blog post).

thx Marc

[Stackoverflow uses Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/case-
studies/).

Elasticsearch has a
[highlighting](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
request-highlighting.html)-features that take care of these things.

The snippet is determined search time, to find the snippet that is most likely
to be relevant for the user's query.
