21379551 logstash elasticsearch and kibana does not show results

i have logstash elasticsearch and kibana3 in one machine. I have install it as
bundle. Everything looks normal but no results in kibana interface.

"No results There were no results because no indices were found that match
your selected time span" Redis-cli Lpop shown proggress so i assume ti works>
When i type in my browser
`http://172.16.1.178:9200/logstash-2014.01.27/_mapping?pretty=true` I get

    
    
    {
      "error" : "RemoteTransportException[Failed to deserialize exception response from stream]; nested: TransportSerializationException[Failed to deserialize exception response from stream]; nested: StreamCorruptedException[unexpected end of block data]; ",
      "status" : 500
    }
    

Can you help?

Thanks

This is a known issue when you use different versions of java on different
machines. It doesn't seem to be your case thought. [Take a look at
it](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3145#issuecomment-27455667)
for more details.

> This is due to a bug in Java where they changed how InetAddress gets
serialized over the wire sadly. ES uses Java serialization only when it
serializes exception over the wire, and sadly that causes it.
