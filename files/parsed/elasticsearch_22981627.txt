22981627 What is a cluster health in Elasticsearch?

I'm new to Elastic Search, and I'm trying to figure out what does the cluster
health represent. I have looked through the
[references](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html)
and [ES definitive
guide](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html)
but I can't find the answer.

This is described in the [cluster health api
page](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-
health.html). The status is the key piece of information to look for.

  * Red = One or more primary shards are missing 
  * Yellow = All primary shards are allocated but replicas are not 
  * Green = All primary and replica shards have been allocated
