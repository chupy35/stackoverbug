26940863 Spring Boot 1.1.9+ addResourceHandler not working for static assets
for absolute paths

I have a spring boot application with static html, css, and img files we want
to keep outside of the /static directory (during development) for purposes of
modularity and easy reloading and developing. It is our front end component
written in AngularJS. Problem is in 1.1.8, the following registration worked:

    
    
    String userDir = System.getProperties().getProperty("user.dir");
    String prefix = "file:";
    
    registry.addResourceHandler("/diagnostics/systemstatusng/**").addResourceLocations(prefix + userDir + "/myAngularFrontend1/app/**");
    registry.addResourceHandler("/loginondemand/**").addResourceLocations(prefix + userDir + "/myAngularFrontEnd2/app/**");
    

But in spring-boot-starter 1.1.9 (and 1.2.0.RC1), this no longer works.

Looking at this recent post [How to dynamically add static resources to
spring-boot jar
application?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25871131/how-to-dynamically-
add-static-resources-to-spring-boot-jar-application), seems like it should
work, but we've tried left and right and cant figure out why it doesnt work in
spring boot starter 1.1.9 and later. Any insight would be appreciated.

The resource locations need to be directories (not patterns) ending in "/",
e.g.

    
    
    registry.addResourceHandler("/diagnostics/systemstatusng/**").addResourceLocations(prefix + userDir + "/myAngularFrontend1/app/");
    

Nothing changed in Spring Boot (this is a core Spring MVC feature), so you
must have just been doing it differently before.
