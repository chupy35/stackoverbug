21021275 Delete particular record from ElasticSearch through java api

My index contain index Type,I want to delete particular document from given
key following query is sql

    
    
    delete * from tablename where name="abc";
    

My ElasticSearch query :

    
    
    DeleteByQueryResponse response = client.prepareDeleteByQuery(indexName)
                                                        .setQuery(termQuery(”_type”, “type1”))
                                                        .execute()
                                                        .actionGet();
    

But i think it will delete type not particluar record...

Anyone knows

Thanks in advance

Just replace the term query values...

    
    
     .setQuery(termQuery(”name”, “abc”))
     .setFilter(FilterBuilders.typeFilter("type1")
