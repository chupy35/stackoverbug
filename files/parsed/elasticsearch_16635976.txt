16635976 ElasticSearch: How to specify specific fields to search at?

Right now in my mapping, I am setting "include_in_all" to true, which means
all the fields are included in _all field.

However, when I am searching, instead of wasting space, and putting everything
in the _all field, I want to specify the specific fields to certain for (and
taking into account the boost scores in the mapping).

How do I create a query that tells Elastic Search to only look at specific
fields(not just 1) and take into account the boosting I gave it during my
mapping?

You don't need to keep data in `_all` field to query for a field.

You can use [query_string](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-
dsl/query-string-query/) or
[bool](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/bool-query/)
queries to search over multiple fields.

Start with a [multi_match](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-
dsl/multi-match-query/) query. It allows you to query multiple fields, giving
them different weights, and it's usually the way to go when you have a search
box.

    
    
    {
      "multi_match" : {
        "query" : "this is a test",
        "fields" : [ "subject^2", "message" ]
      }
    }
    

The query_string is more powerful but more dangerous too since it's parsed and
can break. Use it only if you need it.
