26597958 Communicating between comments in different sub-trees

I am implementing a Gantt chart editing as a collection of React.js
components. I am struggling with how to communicate between components during
interactions. For example, when a bar in the Gantt chart is dragged I want to
update the dependent bars. Dependent bars probably don't have a parent-child
relationship in the DOM - so I need to be able to communicate between
relatively unrelated components to get the dependent bars re-rendered in a new
location.

I tried setState at the top level and letting the change propagate down
through the hierarchy, but this is far too slow while dragging when there are
a lot of bars on the screen.

Having each bar/component register event handlers seems like a lot of overhead
since each would need to register a handler for a different event (since I
only want to update the bars that need to be redrawn).

If I could get a 'pointer' to a component instance I could store that
temporarily in the graph data structure that stores the bars. Then I can call
setState on only the components that need to be updated.

Are events really the right solution for this situation?

Well I bit the bullet and implemented a pub/sub based solution and it was not
as ugly as I had expected. In fact I can see the decoupling benefit that it
provides - now that I have the infrastructure in place I can trigger updates
from many other places in the code.
