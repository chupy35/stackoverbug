29637098 Spring boot - parachute is non existent error

I use spring boot 1.1.6 in our application. Its running for a while without
any issues and started throwing the following error all of sudden.

SEVERE:Memory usage is low, parachute is non existent, your system may start
failing.

I tried setting -Xms and -Xmx to the higher value. But still getting the same
error. Is there any setting i am missing.

Thanks, Baskar.S

Adding -XX:MaxPermSize to a higher value solved the problem.
