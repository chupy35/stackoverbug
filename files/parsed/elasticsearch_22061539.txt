22061539 Creating 2 elasticsearch instances on single machine on same port

I have tried to install two elasticsearch instances in single server and
failed to do so ( on same port). Is there any way i can create 2 elasticsearch
instances in same server and on same port. Will reverse proxy help here. If so
how.

Creating 2 Elasticsearch instances on the same server and the same port is
impossible, and pointless.

Just set 2 instances running on the same box, put have them pointed at
different ports, one at the default port of 9200 and one at port 9300. Give
them the same cluster name and they will automatically network together.

One important point, make sure you set the data and plugin directories to
different locations otherwise you'll get data from one node writing over the
data from the other node.

EDIT:

By the way, if you're looking to create 2 completely separate clusters on the
same machine you still need to do what I said above, but just make sure the
cluster name is different in each configuration file so that they don't
network together.
