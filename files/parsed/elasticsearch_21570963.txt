21570963 Boosting in Elasticsearch

I am new to elasticsearch. In elasticsearch we can use the term boost in
almost all queries. I understand it's used for modify score of documents. But
i can't find actual use of it. My doubt is if i use boost values in some
queries, will it affect final score of search or the boost rank of docs in
index itself.

And what is main difference between boost at index and boost at querying..

Thanks in Advance..!

Boost at query time won't modify your index. It only applies boost factor on
fields when searching.

I prefer boost at query time as it's more flexible. If you need to change your
boost rules and you had set it at index time, you will probably need to
reindex.

Query time boost allows you to give more weight to one query than to another.
For instance, let's say you are querying the `title` and `body` fields for
"Quick Brown Fox", you could write it as:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "should": [
            {
              "match": {
                "title": "Quick Brown Fox"
              }
            },
            {
              "match": {
                "body": "Quick Brown Fox"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

But you decide that you want the `title` field to be more important than the
`body` field, which means you need to `boost` the query on the `title` field
by (eg) 2:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "should": [
            {
              "match": {
                "title": {
                  "query": "Quick Brown Fox",
                  "boost": 2
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "match": {
                "body": "Quick Brown Fox"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

(Note how the structure of the `match` clause changed to accommodate the
`boost` parameter).

The `boost` value of `2` doesn't double the `_score` exactly - the scores go
through a normalization process. So you should think of `boost` as _make this
query clause relatively more important than the other query clauses_.

> My doubt is if i use boost values in some queries. will it affect final
score of search

Yes it does, but you shouldn't rely on the actual value of `_score` anyway.
Its only purpose is to allow Elasticsearch to decide which documents are most
relevant **to this query**. If the query changes, the scores change.

Re index time boosting: don't use it. It's inflexible and error prone.
