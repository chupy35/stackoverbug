10666345 Angularjs : Learning how ngChecked works

I tried modifying the ng-checked example so that clicking on one of the
checkboxes would automatically update the other.

Clicking A, then B, then A again, is not doing what I'm expecting.

What part of the documentation should I look at to understand what's happening
?

Why don't you connect both checkboxes to the same model ?

    
    
    <div ng-app>
      A - Check me to check both: 
        <input type="checkbox" ng-model="master"><br/>
      B - Check me to check both:
        <input type="checkbox" ng-model="master">
    </div>â€‹

==================================================================================

To explain your fiddle:

`ng-checked` does not update the model, it only updates the view (checkbox),
once the expression changes.

Click A: the `master` is changed to `true`, the B checkbox is watching its
`ng-checked` value and therefore updates the view to be checked as well.

Click B: the `master2` is changed to `false`, the A checkbox is watching its
`ng-checked` value and therefore updates the view to be unchecked as well.

Click A: the `master` is set to `true` and that's not really a change as the
value already was `true`, so it does not trigger update of B.
