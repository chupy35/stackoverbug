11776510 elasticsearch downloadable manual

Does anyone know where I can find a downloadable manual (any format) for
elasticsearch? <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/> is OK, but sometimes the
site is not reachable, and searching for content is not practical.

Not that I am aware of. You can fork and run the site locally if you have
problems with it not being reachable which btw never happens for me. It is
available on github:
<https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/docs>

Here is the GitHub repo for all the documentation for their products:
<https://github.com/elastic/docs>

Please note the following disclaimer in the repo:
