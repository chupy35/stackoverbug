18065667 ElasticSearch won't sort

My ElasticSearch query with sort doesn't sort:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "match_all": {}
      },
      "sort": [
        {
          "id": {
            "order": "desc"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    

Adding the "sort" doesn't have any effect except that every result now has an
additional attribute

    
    
    sort: [0]
    

It looks like the "sort" attribute is 0, therefore the order of the results
doesn't change.

"id" is an actual attribute of the documents in my index. Changing it to
"idFOOBAR" throws "[No mapping found for [idFOOBAR] in order to sort on]", so
it seems to recognize the attribute. Also tried other attributes like "userId"
etc., same outcome.

Am I missing something?

Changing the attribute mapping from `index="no"` to `index="not_analyzed"`
fixed it.
