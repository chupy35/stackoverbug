22760395 haystack elasticsearch facet but disregard filters on this query

Using haystack solr I can do this:

    
    
    # facet by category but disregard any category filters on this query
    squeryset = squeryset.facet('{!ex=category}category')  
    

which will give me facets for the category but ignore any category filters

Now how do I do the same query using elasticsearch?

It's for when someone queries for something with a specific category, I can
show the counts for the other categories they did not select.

I was looking for the same thing. See <http://demo.fullscale.co/multiselect/>
for a working demo to do this in ES. It is however not supported by Haystack.
I'm working on that to make it work. Paul
