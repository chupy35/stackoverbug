28274147 Does a "static" rendering of a React page always duplicate content in
JS objects?

Looking at this isomorphic react page: <http://jlongster.com/Presenting-The-
Most-Over-Engineered-Blog-Ever>

I see that there is a Javascript variable at the bottom of the static content
that represents the static content.

So the content is replicated when downloading.

Is this mandatory for the way react works? Any more efficient methods?

You need to have the data included so that you can mount the application on
the client. The initial client side render must produce the same virtual dom
as the server gave.

You could fetch it async, and wait until it downloads to mount the app, but
there will be a significant delay between when the user reaches the page, and
when JavaScript is actually applied. It'll also double the load on the
database for initial requests.

Overall, server rendering will improve the time it takes for the user to see
content, improve SEO, enable page caching with a CDN, and other benefits that
outweigh the costs by far.

It's less important for sites behind a login, and you can often save
significant development time by omitting it.
