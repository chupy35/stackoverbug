24715243 Elasticsearch change field date format

When i created my index and type a while ago I specified the date format of a
field in the mapping as:

    
    
    {"type": "date","format" : "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss"}
    

Is there a way to change the format of the field knowing that now i have more
than 6000 docs indexed in my index ? I want the format to be:

    
    
    {"type": "date","format" : "dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss"}
    

You cannot change field mappings after you have indexed documents into
Elasticsearch. You can add new fields but you cannot change existing fields.

You could create a new index with the new mappings and then re-index all the
data into it. You could then delete the old index and create a new index alias
with the old name point to the new index.

There are a few strategies documented for minimizing downtime when changing
mappings in the Elasticsearch blog:
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/changing-mapping-with-zero-downtime/>

Overall I'd highly suggest using index aliases - they provide a high level of
abstraction and flexibility over using index names directly within your
application. Perfect for situations like this where you want to make a change
to the underlying index:

aliases.html>

You can update format mapping on an existing date field with the PUT mapping
API:

    
    
    PUT twitter/_mapping/user 
    {
      "properties": {
        "myDate": {
          "format": "dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss"
        }
      }
    }
    

_format_ is one of the few mappings that can be updated on existing fields
without losing data
