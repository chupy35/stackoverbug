17245581 ElasticSearch: Replicas of shards only?

I have 2 nodes in my ElasticSearch cluster with 1 index. The index is setup to
have 5 shards, and 1 replica. I want all 5 shards to be in 1 node, with a
replica of each in another node. I don't want ElasticSearch to distribute
those 5 shards equally among the 2 nodes (and distribute the replicas equally
as well).

In other words, I want 1 node to act strictly as a backup, holding ALL the
replicas. Is this possible with ElasticSearch? If so, what settings do I need
to configure?

AFAIK - Master-slave cannot be done just by using Elastic Search.

Elastic search by design uses a different strategy for resilience (node-node).
Here is a document explaining the difference -

Note - the original document is in elasticsearch.cn, couldn't locate the
corresponding English document.

The master-slave concept is something that Solr supports.

That being said, if you need a master-slave setup, I would think of using
something like a load-balancer to isolate the 'master' and 'replica' instance
of ES.

Also note - you can configure ES to have just worker nodes (that do not hold
data, but just process search request).
