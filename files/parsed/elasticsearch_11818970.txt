11818970 Setting Up Elastic Search for my Website

I am completely new to web development and I want to set up a database search
client on a website I am making because I do not want to write my own
inefficient MySQL query strings. My plan is to use Elastic Search for this and
my main question is:

Once my site is on a dedicated server somewhere, how do I install Elastic
Search to the server, and/or what should I look for in a server so that I will
be able to use Elastic Search?

You'll need a JRE, that's about it as far just getting started.

See <http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/setup/installation.html> for
more details.

You'll probably want to run it as a service, If your using Windows you can
download installers here. <https://github.com/rgl/elasticsearch-
setup/downloads>

Hit me up if you need any help.
