22567368 Elasticsearch - indexing and searching on postal addresses

I am creating an elasticsearch index from a database table using the jdbc-
river plugin, which is touching a customer table joined with a customer's
address table, a one-to-many relationship

Currently, the database has separate fields for address information into
street1, street2, street3, city, state, zip respectively

here is a snippet of the search i conduct on customers and their addresses, i
am conducting a boolean query that should multi-match on the street fields,
and match queries on the others, minimum should match of 3

    
    
       "query": {
          "bool": {
             "should": [
                {
                   "match": {
                      "FIRST_NAME": {
                         "query": "James"
                      }
                   }
                },
                {
                   "match": {
                      "LAST_NAME": "Smith"
                   }
                },
            {
               "multi_match": {
                  "query": "10020 Pacific Mesa",
                  "fields": [
                     "STREET1",
                     "STREET2",
                     "STREET3"
                  ]
               }
            },
            {
               "match": {
                  "CITY": "San Diego"
               }
            },
            {
               "match": {
                  "STATE_CODE": "CA"
               }
            },
            {
                   "match": {
                      "ZIPCODE": "92121"
                   }
                }
             ],
             "minimum_should_match": "3"
          }
       }
    }
    

While this works, it can provide high scores for customers who match the first
name, city and zipcode, as they have met the criteria of minimum 3 matches

My question is, how can I improve on this setup?

Ideas/Questions i had were:

  1. is it an issue of boosting , say street over state/zip?
  2. Should i be ignoring state altogether, since zip should correlate to state anyways?
  3. Should i just be indexing all of the street fields together as one rather than performing a multi-match on three fields
  4. Is match good enough, or should i be looking into creating synonyms , as user input could be "112 Second Ave" versus "112 **2nd** Avenue"

I honestly am just looking for suggestions and guides for making the highest
quality search, I attempted looking for examples but found no relevant info
regarding postal address indexing

Anyways, thanks for your time
