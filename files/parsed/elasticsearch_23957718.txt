23957718 What is the effect of adding a word separator in Elastic Search
multi-match query?

I have the following query in Elastic search:

What is the difference in specifying a + character between the 2 search terms
?

Thus: "query": "animation+function" OR "query": "animation function"

    
    
    "query": {
            "multi_match": {
              "query": "animation+function",
              "type": "best_fields",
              "fields": [
                "title",
                "body"
              ]
            }
    

thx Marc
