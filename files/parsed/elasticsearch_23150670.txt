23150670 elasticsearch match vs term query

I use the match query search for "request.method": "GET":

    
    
        {
          "query": {
            "filtered": {
              "query": {
                "match": {
                  "request.method": "GET"
                }
              },
              "filter": {
                "bool": {
                  "must": [
    ...
    

As expected, the Match query can get the results, as shown below:

But the question is when using the Term query, there is no results.

Update the query to change the "match" to "term", and keep the other part
remain the same:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "filtered": {
          "query": {
            "term": {
              "request.method": "GET"
            }
          },
          "filter": {
            "bool": {
              "must": [
    ...
    

I think the Term query is the "not analyzed" version of the Match query. As
shown in above picture, there is at least one record has "request.method"
equal to "GET". Why there is no results for the above-mentioned Term query?
Thank you.

Assuming you are using the [Standard
Analyzer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
standard-analyzer.html) `GET` becomes `get` when stored in the index. The
source document will still have the original "GET".

The `match` query will apply the same standard analyzer to the search term and
will therefore match what is stored in the index. The `term` query does not
apply any analyzers to the search term, so will only look for that exact term
in the inverted index.

To use the term query in your example, change the upper case "GET" to lower
case "get" or change your mapping so the request.method field is set to
`not_analyzed`.
