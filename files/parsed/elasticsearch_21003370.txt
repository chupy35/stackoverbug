21003370 ElasticSearch returns document in search but not in GET

I'm doing a search of documents in my index, then subsequently trying to get
some of them by `_id`. Despite receiving a set of results, some of the
documents can not be retrieved with a simple get. Worse still, I CAN get the
same document with a URI search where `?_id:<the id>`

Just for example, running a simple GET

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/keepbusy_process__issuer_application/KeepBusy__Activities__Activity/neHSKSBCSv-OyAYn3IFcew'
    

Gives me the result:

    
    
    {
      "_index" : "keepbusy_process__issuer_application",
      "_type" : "KeepBusy__Activities__Activity",
      "_id" : "neHSKSBCSv-OyAYn3IFcew",
      "exists" : false
    }
    

But if I do a search with same _id:

    
    
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/keepbusy_process__issuer_application/KeepBusy__Activities__Activity/_search?q=_id:neHSKSBCSv-OyAYn3IFcew'
    

I get the expected result:

    
    
    {
      "took": 2,
      "timed_out": false,
      "_shards": {
        "total": 5,
        "successful": 5,
        "failed": 0
      },
      "hits": {
        "total": 1,
        "max_score": 1.0,
        "hits": [
          {
            "_index": "keepbusy_process__issuer_application",
            "_type": "KeepBusy__Activities__Activity",
            "_id": "neHSKSBCSv-OyAYn3IFcew",
            "_score": 1.0,
            "_source": {
              "template_uid": "KeepBusy__Activities__Activity.create application",
              "name": "create application",
              "updated_at": "2014-01-08T10:02:33-05:00",
              "updated_at_ms": 1389193353975
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

I'm indexing documents through the stretcher ruby API, and immediately after
indexing I'm doing a refresh. My local setup is **2 nodes**. I'm running
**v0.90.9**

There is nothing obvious in the logs why this should fail. I've restarted the
cluster and everything appears to start correctly, but the result is the same.

Is there something I'm missing or some way I can further diagnose this issue?

This issue typically occurs when documents are indexed with non-default
routing (either explicitly set or deducted from parent's id in case of
parent/child documents). If this is the case, try specifying correct
[routing](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-
get.html#get-routing) in you get request.
