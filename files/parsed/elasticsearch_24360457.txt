24360457 Search by ignore value case checking

In my index I have inserted fields without changing the case of values(Upper
case or Lower case), like in my elasticsearch document a field `name` contains
value `Hello World`. And i have made `name` field as `not_analyzed` for exact
match. But in that case, when i search by `hello world` this document donâ€™t
returned by elasticsearch, might be due to case sensitivity. I have tried by
using `term query` and `match query` but haven't found a luck.

Please suggest, if there is a way.  
Thanks

The only way you can do this in Elasticsearch is by analyzing the field and
using token filters. There is a lowercase token filter available that you
should use but this can't really be done on-the-fly like SQL where you wrap
the field to be queried against in something like LOWER().

To get the effect you desire I would use something like the [Keyword
tokenizer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current//analysis-
keyword-tokenizer.html) with the [Lowercase token
filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-
lowercase-tokenfilter.html). If you set this analyzer to be the default
analyzer for indexing and searching then your searches will also be case
insensitive too.
