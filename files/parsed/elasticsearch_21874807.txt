21874807 How to manually cluster nodes on elasticsearch

I have two servers.

    
    
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy
    

In elastic search config, how to I manually add. I am not a fan of discovery.
It does not work.

Each node is eligible to be master. I am using digital ocean.

Assuming you're using zen discovery, you can disable the multi-cast option and
set the addresses of the unicast hosts to discover.

If you're using the default port of 9300 on your nodes, the settings below
should work in your configuration file

    
    
    # disable multicast
    discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
    
    # set the list of hosts for unicast discovery
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [“xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx”, “yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy”]
