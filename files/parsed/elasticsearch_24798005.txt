24798005 Returning the latest version of a document in elasticsearch

I am in need of some help with returning only the latest version of the
documents that I have indexed in elasticsearch.

My documents have a field called `version`(for internal system versioning) and
I index a new document every time there is an update made and increment the
version field for the new document

How would I query the index so that it only returns the the latest version out
of n amount, where `"id": n"`

**EDIT**

The documents that are being versioned have an id with `.n` version number
appended at the end and I want to return the latest version of each of these
within an index using the `version` field

So each time a new document is added the version field increments by 1 right.

Then version with maximum value would be the latest version. You can use max
aggregation to get that.

    
    
    {
        "aggs" : {
            "latest" : { "max" : { "field" : "version" } }
        }
    }
    

I figured out a work around. I had to add a `bool isLatestVersion` Property
onto my object and I do a query that filters on that.
