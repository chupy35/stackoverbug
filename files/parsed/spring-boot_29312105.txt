29312105 Spring rest controller in management port?

When using **spring-boot** , how to you expose a controller at management
port, the port defined by _management.port_?

Okay, I ended up implementing

    
    
    org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.mvc.MvcEndpoint
    

This exposes the Controller into management port rather than application port.
