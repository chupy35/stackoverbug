23997883 Elasticsearch - query_string, _all fields, lower score for particular
field

I'm looking for a way to lower the score for matches in one field in a
`query_string` search with the `default_field` set to `_all`. Any help would
be appreciated!

My current query looks something like this (assuming the user entered two
keywords, foo and bar): ` { "query":{ "bool":{ "must":[ { "query_string":{
"analyzer":"whitespace", "default_field":"_all", "query":"foo~ AND bar~" } } ]
} } } ` Assuming some data like this: ` { prop: 'foo is here', prop2: 'bar is
there', lessImportant: '' }, { prop: '', prop2: 'foo is bar', lessImportant:
'' }, { prop: '', prop2: '', lessImportant: 'bar is foo' } ` I need a way to
make sure that documents that have a match in `lessImportant` have a lower
score than matches in other fields, so that #2 is always returned before #3.
