23563768 Boost a document based on the existence of a field

Is it possible to boost a document's relevance based on the presence of a
field? I've read about [function score
queries](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
boost-field.html#function-score-instead-of-boost) but I'm wondering how
existence is taken into account - from my understanding, the
`field_value_factor` applies to the content of the field, not on its presence.

Use a [function score
query](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-function-score-query.html#_using_function_score) with an [exists-
filter](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-
dsl-exists-filter.html#query-dsl-exists-filter) as a boosting filter.

Function score query is a possibility, however a score function is
computationally expensive and not necessary (keep in mind `exists` query used
below may not have been available in 2014).

Can do the following:

    
    
    POST _search
    {
      "query": {
        "bool" : {
          "should" : [
            { 
              match_all: {
                "boost": 10
              } 
            },
            {
             "exists": {
               "field": "some_field_that_should_exist"
              }
            }           
          ],
          "minimum_should_match" : 2,
        }
      }
    }
    

With a minimum should match of 2 we say that both clauses must match in order
for the should clause to match. This prevents the boost from being applied to
documents that do not have the field.
