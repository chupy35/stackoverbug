13614453 How to perform indices query in ElasticSearch?

What URL do you use to perform an indices query?

I see the following here, but what is the URL to do it too?
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/indices-query.html>

The only way I know how to query in elastic search is with the URI:

    
    
    http://localhost:9200/myindex
    

The issue I am having is I have multiple indexes with different documents
myindex1 myindex2 myindex3

and I want to be able to just perform any query on myindex1 and myindex2 (or
just myindex2 and myindex3)

Is this possible? Also can you combine index query with QueryDSL like
match_all query or Terms Query:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/terms-query.html>

Please show an example of a sample URL, and what goes in the body of the
request if possible so I can get an idea.

You could try:

    
    
     curl http://localhost:9200/myindex1,myindex2/_search?q=*
    

Or

    
    
     curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/myindex1,myindex2/_search -d '{
        // your query here
     }'
    

Is it what you are looking for?

You could do this a couple of different ways.

1) With an indices query on `myindex1` and `myindex2` with a terms query on
the `title` field.

    
    
    curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/_search -d '{
      "query": {
        "indices": {
          "indices": [
            "myindex1",
            "myindex2"
          ],
          "query": {
            "terms": {
              "title": [
                "foo",
                "bar"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }'
    

2) By specifying the indices you want to search in the URI (with the same
exact terms query).

    
    
    curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/myindex1,myindex2/_search -d '{
      "query": {
        "terms": {
          "title": [
            "cookies",
            "cake"
          ]
        }
      }
    }'
    

And yes, you can swap out the terms query for a match_all query (or any other
query [here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/), really)
in either of the two examples. Here's how you would do a match_all query in
the second example:

    
    
    curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/myindex1,myindex2/_search -d '{
      "query": {
        "match_all": {}
      }
    }'
    

I recommend installing the elastic-head plugin. The 3rd tab on that interface
has a query builder. You can select an index, build a query, and take a look
at the dsl query it produces. That's a quick way to get up to speed on the dsl
query syntax.

If you are using sense plugin you can write like this

    
    
     POST myindex1/_search
    {
    "query": {"match_all": {}}
     }
