23948107 reload elasticsearch after changing elasticsearch.yml

How to make `elasticsearch` apply new configuration?  I changed one string in
file `~ES_HOME/config/elasticsearch.yml`:

    
    
    # Disable HTTP completely:
    #
    http.enabled: false
    

Then tried to reload `elasticsearch`:

    
    
    elasticsearch reload
    

Then tried to restart `elasticsearch`:

    
    
    elasticsearch restart
    

Then checked and see that http requests are still acceptable to elastic
search.

So my settings are not applied.

My os is `os X`. ElasticSearch version is `1.2.0`

If ElasticSearch is installed on Windows setup then you have to restart
ElasticSearch windows service.

Thanks.

Strangely or not so, the supposed way to do it is just to stop the service,
and start it again :)

I.E. get its pid (running _ps axww | grep elastic_ ), and then _kill ESpid_ ;
just be sure to use the TERM signal, to give it a chance to close properly.

Some *nix elasticsearch distros have control scripts wrappers for start/stop ,
but I don't think OS X does.

And on a side note, you have probably found the [Cluster Update
Settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-
update-settings.html "Cluster Update Settings") API, and though it provides
quite a few options, regretfully it can't be used to change that particular
setting.

HTH

P.S. And yep, in Windows setup the services.msc is the way to do it, but doubt
this is helpful for you :)
