25354701 Creating a mapping for an existing index with a new type in
elasticsearch

I found an article on elasticsearch's site describing how to 'reindex without
downtime', but that's not really acceptable every time a new element is
introduced that needs to have a custom mapping
(<http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/changing-mapping-with-zero-downtime/>)

Does anyone know why I can't create a mapping for an existing index but a new
type in elasticsearch? The type doesn't exist yet, so why not? Maybe I'm
missing something and it IS possible? If so, how can that be achieved?

Thanks, Vladimir

Here is a simple example to create two type mapping in a index, (one after
another)

I've used **i1** as index and **t1** and **t2** as types,

  1. **Create index**
    
        curl -XPUT "http://localhost:9200/i1"

  2. **Create type 1**
    
        curl -XPUT "http://localhost:9200/i1/t1/_mapping" -d
    {
       "t1": {
          "properties": {
             "field1": {
                "type": "string"
             },
             "field2": {
                "type": "string"
             }
          }
       }
    }'

  3. **Create type 2**
    
        curl -XPUT "localhost:9200/i1/t2/_mapping" -d'
    {
       "t2": {
          "properties": {
             "field3": {
                "type": "string"
             },
             "field4": {
                "type": "string"
             }
          }
       }
    }'

Now Looking at mapping( `curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/i1/_mapping"` ), It
seems like it is working.

Hope this helps!! Thanks
