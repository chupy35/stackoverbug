17592682 using TTL with bulk_index in elasticsearch

I am trying to user bulk insert with a ttl value but I could not do it. here
is the curl request I am doing.

All I am trying to do is insert some values that has certain ttl. Does anybody
tell me what I am doing wrong. I could not find any example usage about this.

    
    
    curl -XPOST 'http://10.9.8.7:9200/_bulk?_ttl=1&op_type=create' -d '{"index": {"_type": "numbers", "_index": "index"}}
    {"name": 1, "number": 1}
    {"index": {"_type": "numbers", "_index": "index"}}
    {"name": 2, "number": 2}
    {"index": {"_type": "numbers", "_index": "index"}}
    {"name": 3, "number": 3}
    {"index": {"_type": "numbers", "_index": "index"}}
    {"name": 4, "number": 4}
    

what's the error/response? Did you enable ttl in your mapping?

Default is off according to this:
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/ttl-field/> Also, you
can set a default ttl in your mapping.

And according to this
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/bulk/>, ttl should go in the
body and not the url.
