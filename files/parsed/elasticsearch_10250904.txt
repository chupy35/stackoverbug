10250904 unable to install elasticsearch plugin

I've downloaded elastic search plugin from

<https://github.com/downloads/spinscale/elasticsearch-suggest-
plugin/elasticsearch-suggest-0.0.3-0.18.6.zip>

I've unzipped the folder and I know i'm supposed to put the 3 jar files in the
lib/ directory (of play itself or of the application I'm creating or that of
elasticsearch). but which lib/ directory shall i put it in? also, what shall i
do next. i tried to understand the documentation on the website but i didn't.
I'll really appreciate any help as I've been trying for 2 days to install this
plugin. I'm using play 1.2.4

Try the builtin `bin/plugin` utility:

    
    
    % bin/plugin -url https://github.com/downloads/spinscale/elasticsearch-suggest-plugin/elasticsearch-suggest-0.0.3-0.18.6.zip -install elasticsearch-suggest

Download elastic search deb file from this link [elastic
search](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/downloads)

and once installed then check elastic search status like **sudo service
elasticsearch status** To view elastic search index in GUI, run this command
from your /usr/share directory

**sudo elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head**

**open "http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/"**

### MAC OS - with brew elasticsearch base install

Install the elasticsearch package with brew :

    
    
    brew install elasticsearch
    

Install the elasticsearch_head plugin to get a simple browser :

    
    
    cd /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/1.4.0/
    sudo bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head
    open "http://127.0.0.1:9200/_plugin/head/"

In one line:

    
    
    sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head
    

Using current homebrew installation (March 2016 -- 2.2.0_1 version) resulted
in the plugin executable not being linked, therefore i had to do:

`$ ~HOMEBREW_ROOT/Cellar/elasticsearch/2.2.0_1/libexec/bin/plugin install
mobz/elasticsearch-head`

Grab the **plugin script path** by using this command on Mac OS

`brew info elasticsearch`

Then, use the **plugin script path** to install:

`/usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/2.3.3/libexec/bin/plugin install some/es-
plugin`
