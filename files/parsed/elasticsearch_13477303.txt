13477303 Multiple nodes in ElasticSearch

How can I have multiple nodes in my ElasticSearch? I'm using the following in
elasticsearch.yml but only the last node starts, and the browser complains:
`The page at file://localhost/ says: undefined`.

    
    
    node.name: "No Data"
    node.master: true
    node.data: false
    
    node.name: "Data One"
    node.master: false
    node.data: true
    
    node.name: "Data Two"
    node.master: false
    node.data: true
    

I think the simplest way to do it is by specifying these parameters on the
command line. To start three nodes you just need to run the following three
commands in elasticsearch home directory:

    
    
    $ bin/elasticsearch -Des.node.data=false -Des.node.master=true -Des.node.name=NoData
    $ bin/elasticsearch -Des.node.data=true -Des.node.master=false -Des.node.name=DataOne
    $ bin/elasticsearch -Des.node.data=true -Des.node.master=false -Des.node.name=DataTwo
    

Another solution is to create 3 different config files and start three nodes
with `-Des.config=path-to-config-file` parameter.

First off, you should be trying to access elasticsearch using
`[http://localhost:9200/][1]`, if you are using the default port bindings.

I would set up your master node to also be a data node, there is no reason not
to. If you are trying to start 3 nodes on a single machine. But, starting 3
nodes all on the same machine doesn't make sense as anything other than an
experiment. What are you trying to accomplish?

In windows for 6.x version, command attributes change to

    
    
    elasticsearch -EsomeYamlPropety=someValue
    

First You need change an elasticsearch.yml properties to:

    
    
    http.port: 9200-9299
    transport.tcp.port: 9300-9399
    node.max_local_storage_nodes: 2
    

Because You cant run nodes on single port, and when I try to use command with
argument _-Ehttp.port=9201_ nodes were cant see each other and were creating
two different clusters with the same name.

Run the first node by a standard command:

    
    
    .\bin\elasticsearch
    

Run the second node by command with attributes:

    
    
    .\bin\elasticsearch -Enode.name=NodeTwo -Enode.master=false
