15208719 elasticsearch/kibana query not finding text in _all index

We have an elasticsearch kibana setup for storing log files. Log files are
written using the Flume elasticsearch sink.

If I search for `@fields.environment:"sm-local-mlamley"` then I find the log
events I expect. These log events have a @message field of `2013-03-04
10:05:41.7262|INFO|FlumePOC.Program|SM 101123123 log message fudgesicle`

However, if I search for `"fudgesicle"` then I do not find them. In fact, I
cannot find the entry even if I search for the entire @message field.

How do I go about determining why elasticsearch doesn't seem to be indexing
the data.

You can query Elasticsearch directly, like this:

    
    
    http://elasticsearch-host:port/index-name/index-type/_search?q=search-term
    

You can use wildcards for the name and type, including the empty string. And
if you add `&pretty` to the end it'll slightly format the JSON response. So
you might try:

    
    
    http://elasticsearch-host:9200///_search?q=fudgesicle&pretty
    

That will show you if the log event has made it into ES at all. If it's there
you might get some better indication as to the reason that Kibana can't find
it.
