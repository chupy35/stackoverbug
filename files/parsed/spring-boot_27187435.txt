27187435 How to change bitronix jms pool parameters?

I'm using Spring Boot 1.2.0.RC1 + bitronix + hornetq (embedded) + JPA, and I'd
like to increase bitronix jmsConnectionFactory pool size, currently it's
limited at 10. Is there a simple way to do it, inside application.properties
for example or inside a @Configuration class?

You can't configure it via `application.properties` at the moment (I've opened
[an issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2027)), but
you can do it from a `@Configuration` class by declaring your own
`XAConnectionFactoryWrapper` bean:

    
    
    @Bean
    public XAConnectionFactoryWrapper xaConnectionFactoryWrapper() {
        return new XAConnectionFactoryWrapper() {
            @Override
            public ConnectionFactory wrapConnectionFactory(
                    XAConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
                PoolingConnectionFactoryBean pool = new PoolingConnectionFactoryBean();
                pool.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
                pool.setMaxPoolSize(50);
                return pool;
            }
    
        };
    }
