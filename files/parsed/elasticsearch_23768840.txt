23768840 Autocomplete and suggester combination for Elastic Search

I am trying to make an elastic search autocomplete and suggest. I will be used
for searching for company names. It works OK but the suggest is only performed
on the beginning to the company name. ( E.G. Sports Company inc. will only be
shown for searches starting like 'sports' and not 'company'). I have read
theat the autocomplete is for prefixes, but I want it to work on all words.

My question is how to go about using either; suggest, autocomplete, filters,
tokenizers to get get it working. I understand that they all have influences
on results, but what has more and what has less. I find the docs quite hard to
understand.

I also, would like to know the best way to go about searching all words in a
company name vs prefix only.

                    }
                },
                "filter" : {
                    "company_stopwords" : {
                        "type" : "stop",
                        "stopwords" : [ "the", "a", "." ]
                    }
