23730909 can i backport "pattern_replace" char filter into elasticsearch
0.19.9?

our system is running elasticsearch 0.19.9.  recentyly i'm going to add a new
mapping on it. what i need is merge multiple whitespaces into a single
whitespace.

i do some search ,and find pattern_replace is what i need, code are like

    
    
                    "space_filter":{
                        "type":"pattern_replace",
                        "pattern":"\\s+",
                        "replacement":"\\s"
                    }
    

but the bad news is "pattern_replace" is not introduced until 0.90.*. so is
there possibily to backport this function into the version i'm using?

really i don't want to upgrade this system the newest version, guessing it's
time consuming, as i'm also using es-head and bigdesk. the version match thing
might kill me.
