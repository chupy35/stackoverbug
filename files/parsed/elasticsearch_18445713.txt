18445713 Can you index fields in elasticsearch that cant be searched?

Are you able to index text fields that cannot be searched on when the user
trys to perform any kind of search/match query?

Yes you can, just exclude them from `_all` if you do general purpose query by
setting `include_in_all` to false:
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/core-types/>

As all query run on the `_all` field by default; this should do the trick.
