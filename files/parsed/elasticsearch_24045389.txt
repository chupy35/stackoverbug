24045389 How to return parent id of a child document in Elastic Search?

I have a parent-child relationship in Elastic Search. When I do a search on
the child documents, I also want to get for each child the id of the parent.

I saw that you can use _parent in filtering, but can I also use it in the
"fields" array that I want to return ?

Example of my query:

    
    
    {
      //Fields to return
      "fields":[
        "_parent.id",     >> Does not work
        "_parent.title",  >> Does not work
        "commentText"
      ], 
    
    
      //Query (Filtered query)
      "query":{
        "filtered":{
          //Filter
          "filter":{
            "and":[        
              {
                "type":{ "value": "comment" }
              }
            ]   
          },
          //Query
          "query": {
            "multi_match": {
              "query": "xxx",
              "type": "best_fields",
              "fields": [
                "commentText"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

I think _parent only stores the parent id. Try something like this:

    
    
    "fields":[
        "_parent",     
        "commentText"
      ]
