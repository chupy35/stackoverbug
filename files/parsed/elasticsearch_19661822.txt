19661822 Is it possible to write to multiple indexes with an ElasticSearch
alias?

The [ElasticSearch
Docs](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-
aliases.html) reads:

> An alias can also be mapped to more than one index, and when specifying it,
the alias will automatically expand to the aliases indices.

But when I try to add an alias to 2 indices and write to both, neither seem to
get updated with the document. If I remove one of the aliases, it will write
correctly to the alias that still exists.

Fails with multiple write aliases:

    
    
    $ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases'
    

result:

    
    
    {
      "dev_01": {
        "aliases": {
          "dev_read": {},
          "dev_write": {}
        }
      },
      "dev": {
        "aliases": {
          "dev_write": {}
        }
      }
    }
    

Works with single alias:

    
    
    $ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases'
    

result:

    
    
    {
      "dev_01": {
        "aliases": {
          "dev_read": {},
          "dev_write": {}
        }
      },
      "dev": {
        "aliases": {}
      }
    }
    

Does elasticsearch support writing to multiple indices? Are aliases Read-Only
if pointed at multiple indices?

the answer is No

So it appears I should have triaged this a beep deeper, but the response my
client gets from es is:

> ElasticSearchIllegalArgumentException[Alias [dev_write] has more than one
indices associated with it [[dev_01, dev]], can't execute a single index op

Just wish the docs were a little more explicit up front, as they confused me a
bit

At first seems to imply you can:

> The index aliases API allow to alias an index with a name, with **all** APIs
automatically converting the alias name to the actual index name. An alias can
also be mapped to more than one index...

>

> Associating an alias with more than one index are simply several add
actions...

Further down the page lets you know you can not:

> It is an error to index to an alias which points to more than one index.
