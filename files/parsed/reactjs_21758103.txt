21758103 React: Passing Props to Descendants

Is there a recommended pattern for passing props to descendant components in
React?

Below, I'm passing the prop `callback` to a child component:

    
    
    Master = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <div>
            <ListComp items={this.props.items} callback={this.handleClick} />
          </div>
        );
      }
    });
    
    ListComp = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
    
        this.props.items.forEach(function(item) {
          items.push(<ItemView item={item} callback={this.props.callback} />);
        }, this);
    
        return (
          <ul>{items}</ul>
        );
      }
    });
    

And then the `callback` prop gets handed down to the descendant component:

    
    
    ItemComp = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <li><a onClick={this.handleClick} href="#">Link</a></li>
        );
      },
    
      handleClick: function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        this.props.callback();
      }
    });
    

Is it correct to pass the prop down twice like this or should I be referencing
its inheritance somehow?

I see a `transferPropsTo` method in the docs, and from logging it looks like I
could get to `callback` from the descendant via `this.props.__owner__.props`
but those double-double underscores make me think I shouldn't.

Yes, this is idiomatic. Think of each component as a function whose arguments
are the props â€“ with that perspective, passing around the props explicitly
seems a lot more normal. We've found that it makes things more maintainable to
have everything be explicit so you can see what all the inputs to a component
are and exactly what you're passing.

(A future version of React will probably include a feature called "contexts"
which makes it possible to pass things down implicitly, but it will probably
make code harder to reason about so I'd still favor explicitness almost all of
the time.)

**UPDATE** (not by original author)

The documentation has finally been added (it was added sometime between summer
2015 and summer 2016, probably with release 0.14):

[Official React Context
Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html).

Note that this is also how [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-
redux) simplifies passing of stores through the hierarchy.
