15773476 elasticsearch client thread safety

I am writting a query plugin, that will build the query for given keywords and
pass it to elastic search client to process.

My handler class extends BaseRestHandler, and I've the Client object being
injected in my handler's constructor.

    
    
    @Inject
    protected QueryHandler(Settings settings, Client client, RestController controller) {
        super(settings, client);
        controller.registerHandler(GET, "/_query/{queryBuilder}", this);
    }
    

I was wondering if it's thread safe to use the same client object in
handleRequest() method?

It looks like any implementation of the client is thread safe. Check out
