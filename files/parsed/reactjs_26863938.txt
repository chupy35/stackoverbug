26863938 Modify attributes of children in ReactJS component

I am trying to figure out how to modify the children of a component to for
example, add a class. I have tried to do:

    
    
    var inputReactObject = React.Children.only(this.props.children);
    
    inputReactObject.className = "test";
    

However that does not seem to work.

Is it possible to modify children attributes in a ReactJS component?

As mentioned by @lpiepiora plunker, the code to do what I want would be:

    
    
    var inputReactObject = React.Children.only(this.props.children);
    var clonnedChild = React.addons.cloneWithProps(inputReactObject, {
      className: "input-element test"
    });
    
    return clonnedChild;
    

Now that `cloneWithProps` is
[deprecated](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/03/react-v0.13-rc2.html#react.cloneelement),
the current approach would be

    
    
    var inputReactObject = React.Children.only(this.props.children);
    var clonedChild = React.cloneElement(inputReactObject, {
      className: "input-element test"
    });
    
    return clonedChild;
