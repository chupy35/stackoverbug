23942143 Trouble with spaces in query to elasticsearh

I'm experiencing trouble with requesting fileds making requests on field with
spaces. Mapping looks like this:

    
    
    "myIndexName": {
        "mappings": {
            "myType": {
                "properties": {
                    "myPropertyWithSpaces": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "analyzer": "analyzer_keyword"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

There "analyzer_keyword" is cutom analyzer with keyword tokenizer and
lowercase filter. When I'm sending "_analyze" request with "analyzer_keyword"
analyzer and query like "firstWord secondWord" I get only token "firstword
secondword" - everything works as expected. But querystring request returns
nothing if I don't change space character to "?" wildcard; interesting, that
lowercasing still works and such behaviour doesn't change if I'm telling
elasticsearch to use this "analyzer_keyword" explicitly.

    
    
    "query": {
    "query_string": {
        "query": "firstWord secondWord",
        "default_field": "myPropertyWithSpaces",
        "analyzer": "analyzer_keyword"
    }
    

Found solution in simple escaping space character as "\ ". Works correctly and
prevents queryString processor from injecting any "AND OR" operators or
whatever.
