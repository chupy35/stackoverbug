15822890 How do you write a relative path in elasticsearch.yml?

I want to provide a value for path.data that is relative to the installation
location of ElasticSearch.

Is it possible to do something like this?

` path.data: {ES_DIR}/../../data `

Yes, it is possible:

    
    
    path.data: ${path.home}/../../data
