21530697 forceUpdate VS forceReload

I'm wondering what is the difference between `forceUpdate()` and
`forceReload()` in ReactJS.

Tried to find some documentation about that but couldn't find some on
`forceReload()`-

Thanks in advance!

Not sure where you saw it, but `forceReload` isn't a part of React. You
presumably couldn't find documentation because there isn't any -- if I search
for `"forceReload" react` right now, this question comes up first.

If you want to make a component rerender without changing its state or props,
you should call `forceUpdate`.
