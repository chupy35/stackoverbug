25299762 how to disable shard re-balancing in elastic search, while allowing
new indices to be allocated?

I am using ElasticSearch version 1.0.1 and want to achieve two things at the
same time -  1\. Allow new indices to be created ( the primary and replica
shards need to be allocated as per usual logic).  2\. Prevent existing shards
to be rebalanced on node failure.

What combination of settings will allow me to achieve the same? I tried the
settings from the cluster module documented at
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-
cluster.html>. But I am unable to achieve both of them at the same time.

Thanks,
