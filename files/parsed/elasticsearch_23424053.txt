23424053 elastic search primary key and secondary key

I have an index in elastics search with products. Every product has an article
number in the form of a guid. To show this products on a webshop I don't want
to show a guid (to long). I want an integer number.

Now i have two keys. One to lookup the web request (the integer) and one to
update the product (the guid)

I know I can search on a field in elastic search. But is an exact match search
on a field slower as an exact match on a key (_id)? I don't want to do a
mapping search from one key to the other because that is another operation.

_id field is just a primary key to documents.It will be stored separately.Yes
there will be some lag.But its not that much lag you can find.If you want a
field to search as fast as _id field. Then in mapping store the field
externally. [refer store attribute for a
field](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-
core-types.html#string)

Like other fields its also stored in ES.By default _id not analyzed.If you
define a field as not_analyzed its also fast as _id field.ES indexes each and
ever field as same.

HOpe it helps..!
