23584104 elasticsearch getting indices onto different server

I have an elasticsearch index already on one server I want to move it to a
different one without going through bulk indexing or whatever, the indices
already exist. What's an easy way to move the indices? There should be some
sort of import or some binary that could be copied. Thanks!

I'd use snapshot and restore:
