24835246 How to add email to Spring Boot gradle build

Spring boot has a number of starter dependencies. The default set does not
include support for mail (org.springframework.mail is missing in Boot). How do
I configure my build.gradle to include the spring framework mail support?

Try spring-context-support, ie

    
    
    compile 'org.springframework:spring-context-support'
    

You might find this a helpful tool for that kind of query:

For spring boot you want to use this:

    
    
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-mail")
