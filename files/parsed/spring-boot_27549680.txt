27549680 EnableAutoConfiguration generates unnecessary CGLIB proxies of
repositories

Before Spring Boot 1.2 everything used to work fine, however with this version
the @EnableAutoConfiguration tag causes the generation of CGLIB proxies of the
JDBC repositories. Since these repository classes are marked final, it fails.
I have no problem with making these classes non-final, however I'd like to
understand why CGLIB proxies are needed in this case. However if I remove the
EnableAutoConfiguration tag, everything works as expected, i.e., no CGLIB
proxies are created.

Spring Boot 1.2 added auto-configuration for Spring's persistence exception
translation which requires the use of proxies. You can disable it by setting
`spring.dao.exceptiontranslation.enabled: false` in your
`application.properties` file.
