23055201 How to find the globally defined analyzer name in Elastic search?

When searching in Elastic search, by default, the globally defined analyzer is
used. How can I find out what this analyzer is ? We are using a Elastic search
saas provider and I thus want to find out what the setting is ?

As far as I am aware, Elasticsearch will use the `Standard Analyzer` as
default if none other is specified upon index creation.
