24447441 ElasticSearch: Indexing times out if number_of_replicas is greater
than 1

I'm experimenting with scaling ElasticSearch and want to increase the amount
of replicas, but I am unable to index anything if the number_of_replicas is
set higher than 1.

I've been able to replicate the issue with a fresh install of ES:

  * Download and unzip ES
  * Modify the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file and set the `index.number_of_replicas` setting to 2
  * Run `bin/elasticsearch`
  * Index a test document: `curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/test/example/1' -d '{body:"Hello"}'`
  * Timeout

I'm running the latest version of ES (1.2.1) on a Mac OSX 10.9.2. I've also
been running ES on an Ubuntu Wheezy VM, but I encountered the same problem
there. Setting the number of replicas on an index-basis (using a `PUT`
request) has the same effect. It makes me feel like I'm missing something
fundamental.

Power up more ES nodes (see my second comment)
