use of Analyzer (I know it is a booster) but it helps me in elastic search n
What is the key word "Snowball" mean?

    
    
    'data.description': {'analyzer': 'snowball', 'type': 'string'},
    'data.title': {'analyzer': 'snowball', 'type': 'string'}
    

**Analyzers** are process which extracts indexable terms from text given for
indexing.

For example

In the text "i am a dinosaur from modern age" When this is analyzed against
"stop word" analyzer only dinosaur, modern and age keywords are stored in the
index. Which means if you search for "am", though the word is present in the
text you indexed, it wont point to that indexed document.

Similarly **snowball** is a combination of _stopword_ , _lowercase_ and
standard analyzer -

> The snowball filter is used to stem words based on a specific stemmer. A
stemmer uses some rules to determine the proper stem of a word. That means
different stemmers may return different results.

> For example, the words “indexing”, “indexable”, “indexes”, “indexation”, etc
will be stemmed as “index”. It’s particularly interesting to retrieve a
document with the title “Make my string indexable” when you search “Indexing a
string”. [(c)](http://obtao.com/blog/2013/10/configure-elasticsearch-on-an-
