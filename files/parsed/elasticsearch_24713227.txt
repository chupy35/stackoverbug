24713227 Elasticsearch: how to disable scoring on a field?

I am new to Elasticsearch and please forgive me if the answer is obvious.

Here is what I have for the mapping of the field in question:

    
    
    "condition" : { "type" : "string", "store" : "no", "index": "not_analyzed", "omit_norms" : "true" }
    

I need search on this field, but I need 100% string match (no stemming, etc.)
on a sub-string (blank separated). An example of this field in a document is
as follows:

    
    
    {
        "condition": "abc xyz"
    }
    

An example query is:

    
    
    /_search?q=condition:xyz
    

Is the above mapping correct? I also used omit_norms (true). Is this a correct
thing to do in my case?

How can I disable scoring on this field? Can I do it in mapping? What is the
best way of doing it? (Actually I need to disable scoring on more than one. I
do have fields that need scoring)

Thanks and regards!

Using `omit_norms:true` will not take the length of the field into
consideration for the scoring, Elasticsearch won't index the norms
information. So if you don't want to use scoring that is a good thing to do as
it will save you some disk space.

If you're not interested in scoring in your queries use a filtered query:

    
    
    {
      "query": {
        "filtered": {
          "query": {
            "match_all": {}
          },
          "filter": {
            "bool": {
              "must": {
                "term": {
                  "condition": "abc xyz"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

The new syntax for a filtered query is now:

    
    
    {
    "query": {
      "bool": {
        "must": {
          "match_all": {}
        },
        "filter": {
          "term": {
            "condition": "abc"
          }
        }
       }
      }
    }
