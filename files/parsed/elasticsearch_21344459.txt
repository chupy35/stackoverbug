21344459 How to wipe out elasticsearch local node?

I'm using local nodes for testing (I know about `elasticsearch-test` but don't
see how it can be used when the client is dependency injected) and each time I
run the test, the count increments. What I really want is for the Node to
start fresh each time. How can this be done?

It looks like I can wipe out the `data/elasticsearch` directory but was hoping
for a more elegant solution.

You can fire a DeleteIndex query when starting the test.

But I found that cleaning dir is fine. See
