16453033 Upgrading elasticsearch from 0.20.5 to 0.90.0

I have a 5 node 0.20.5 Elasticsearch cluster, with replicas set to 2, shards
set to 5 and around 70 Million documents that I would like to upgrade to
0.90.0

I can't seem to find definitive instructions for upgrading, I was thinking
something along these lines:

  1. Issue cluster shutdown:

`curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/nodes/_local/_shutdown'`

  2. Upgrade each of the nodes using the 0.90.0 deb package

`dpkg -i elasticsearch-0.20.5.deb`

  3. Start elasticsearch on each of the nodes: 

`/etc/init.d/elasticsearch start`

Should I look at changing any of these settings prior?

`gateway.recover_after_nodes`

`gateway.recover_after_time`

`gateway.expected_nodes`

Cheers!
