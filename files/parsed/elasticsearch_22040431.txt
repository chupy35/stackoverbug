22040431 Elasticsearch get the last ten added events

I have an index with multiple types, one of these being **event** and I would
like to get the last 10 events sorted by their start date

    
    
    {
    
    "from":0, 
    "size":10,
    "query":{
        "range":{
            "start":{
                "from":"2014-02-25 00:00:01 UTC",
                "to":"2014-03-04 23:59:00 UTC"
            }
        }
    },
    "filter" :{
        "and": [
            {
                "type": {
                    "value": "event"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "sort":[
        { "start":
            {"order":"asc"}
        }
    ]
    }
    

I have tried variations of the above query but cannot seem to get it working,
elastic-search does not apply the type filter

the filter syntax above is correct (the and is not needed).

if you are just interested in events you might as well just query their
endpoint (like `localhost:9200/idx/event/_search`)

In fact if you want to use the 'type' in your query, you have to do use the
'_type' name with the underscore. This here is an example:

    
    
    POST /items/_search
    {
        "query": {
            "match": {
               "_type": "item"
            }
        }
    }
