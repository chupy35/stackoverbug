24208599 Using specific child components with a generic parent component

Maybe I'm thinking about this in the wrong way, as I've only just recently
picked up ReactJS, so feel free to correct my method of thinking.

What I want to do is (theoretically) be able to have N specific child
components that can fit into a single parent component, but I'm not sure how
to tell the parent which child to render.

For example, I've written a tab container that just renders a content area
right now. The content area would be the _parent_. I want to have N different
types of items that can go into this content area. These items would be the
_children_. Is it possible for me to use a single parent component and someone
dynamically choose which type of child to render without going through the
hassle of a conditional statement in the parent?

Let me know if my question is not clear.

Thank you in advance!

I sometimes do this like so:

    
    
    var Parent = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return React.DOM.div({}, this.props.childClass(this.props.childProps));
      }
    });
    

or:

    
    
    var Parent = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return React.DOM.div({children: this.props.children});
      }
    });
    
    Parent({}, ChildClass({foo: 'asdf'}))
