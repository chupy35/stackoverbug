25198861 SearchResponse - from and size info in response

I have started to play around with ES, and trying to figure out something with
the responses and the data which was returned.

I have set up basic environment by following the tutorials on ES
documentation, and was able to index some sample docs.

When I query ES with:

    
    
    TransportClient client = new TransportClient().addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress(server.elasticHost, Integer.valueOf(server.elasticPort)));
      SearchResponse response = client.prepareSearch("testme").setTypes("tester").setQuery(elasticQuery).execute().actionGet();
    

I got some docs as response but cant find the "from" and "size" ("start" and
"row" values in Solr, if you are familiar with it)in the JAVA API.

Am I supposed to use some other classes for search retrieval or add some more
params while I am querying ES? I have also come up with
[Scroll](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
request-scroll.html), so is this the way that I can get from - size data?

In your request you haven't set the `from` or `size` parameters, so `from`
defaults to 0 and `size` defaults to 10. If you want to change the defaults or
use `from` and `size` for pagination do so in the request.

    
    
     SearchResponse response = client.prepareSearch("testme")
            .setTypes("tester")
            .setQuery(elasticQuery)
            .setFrom(21)
            .setSize(20)
            .execute().actionGet();
