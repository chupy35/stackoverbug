12702659 How many words to highlight before or/and after matched text

Is it possible with elasticsearch to configure the number of words before and
after matched text? Say for example I am searching for a keyword 'report' and
set wordaround=5 Then it should return only 5 words containing the matched
keyword

Please help me!!!

Try to define your fragment_size
