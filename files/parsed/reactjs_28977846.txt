28977846 this.refs no longer available in componentDidMount?

From the changelog for React v0.13:

"ref resolution order has changed slightly such that a ref to a component is
available immediately after its `componentDidMount` method is called; this
change should be observable only if your component calls a parent component's
callback within your `componentDidMount`, which is an anti-pattern and should
be avoided regardless"

So, is there a better way to access `this.refs` after the DOM mounts? I
dislike using `setTimeout()`, but that is the best method I see to work on a
specific DOM after it mounts. Is there a replacement method I am missing? Or,
is the best way to attach an `onLoad` method directly to the component?

Maybe you are reading too much into this.

My interpretation is that all refs to child components are available in
`componentDidMount`.

The change is that they are not available before the child component's own
`componentDidMount` has completed (which happens before the parent
component's). And you would only be affected by that if you call some callback
from inside `componentDidMount` of the child, and that code tries to use the
`ref` immediately. Which seems like an edge-case and, as they say, an anti-
pattern.

So "normal usage" should not be impacted by this change.

Please try and report back.
