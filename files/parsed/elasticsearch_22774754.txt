22774754 Elasticsearch replica auto undertake shard

Below I have 2 nodes in two servers. 2 indexes each. The indexes are
distributed in 2 shards and 1 replica set.

"Thor" node had a downtime so I "Iron_man" took over. That's fine.

As you can see events_v1 is an index created before the downtime and venue_v1
was created after the downtime. Shouldn't "Thor" after being back alive take
over one shard automatically in the same way as it handles the newly created
venue index?

If yes how should I configure the settings?

You need not to configure anything for above scenario.Because Elasticsearch's
default behavior is same as you requested.if you create replica for a shard in
same node is not allocated to query.If you add new node means your replica
shard will be allocated in newly created node.
