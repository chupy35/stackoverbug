20703793 index field property setting through JAVA API for elastic search

Can i have a sample code for assigning the properties to index fields (as in
config.xml in case of solr), for elasticsearch. Java API code sample for
loading the property file, as well.

    
    
    Settings settings = ImmutableSettings.settingsBuilder().put("client.transport.sniff", true).build();
            Client client = new TransportClient(settings).addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress("localhost", 9300));
            List<XYZ> list = xyz.getObj("5");
            ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
            for(Object obj : list){
                try {
    
                    String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(obj);
                    System.out.println(json);
    
     //I want a code here to load the mapping file and syntax for mapping file,
       through which i can say that only few attributes of this object should be indexed   and rest all to be stored..//                
    
                    IndexRequestBuilder indexRequestBuilder = client.prepareIndex("searchindex", "searchtype", obj.getId());
                    indexRequestBuilder.setSource(json);
                    indexRequestBuilder.execute().actionGet();
