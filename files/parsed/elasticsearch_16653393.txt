16653393 Use existing field as id in elasticsearch

Just started using elasticSearch today. I was wondering if it would be
possible to set in some kind of global parameter to use a certain field within
a document as the ID always?

My JSON documents will always have it's own unique ID

    
    
    {
      "Record ID": "a06b0000004SWbdAAG",
      "System Modstamp": "01/31/2013T07:46:02.000Z",
      "body": "Test Body"
    }
    

Here I would like to use Record ID as the ID field.

Regards

You want to use the path setting, see the docs here:

<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/id-field/>

specifically something like this should work in your mapping:

    
    
    {
        "your_mapping" : {
            "_id" : {
                "path" : "Record ID"
            }
        }
    }
    

I've never tried having variable names split up though. You might want to
camelcase or underscore them if you run into wierdness.
