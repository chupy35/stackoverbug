17285957 Only index certain fields from Wikipedia River

I'm trying to use the [Wikipedia
River](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-river-wikipedia)

Is there a way / How can I customize the mapping so that ElasticSearch only
index the title fields (I'd still like to access the whole text)?

The mapping is useful more to decide how you index data rather than what you
index, unless you set it to `dynamic: false` which means that elasticsearch
effectively accepts only the fields that are explicitly declared in the
mapping.

The problem is that the wikipedia river always sends a set of fields for every
document and this behaviour is not currently configurable, thus there's no way
to index only a subset of those fields (e.g. only `title` and `_source`). What
you could do is modify your search request so that you get back only the
fields that you are interested in, but the content of the index will stay the
same.
