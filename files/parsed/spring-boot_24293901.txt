How to configure spring boot through annotations in order to have something
similar to in web.xml?

    
    
    <jsp-config>
        <jsp-property-group>
            <url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
            <url-pattern>*.jspf</url-pattern>
            <page-encoding>UTF-8</page-encoding>
            <scripting-invalid>false</scripting-invalid>
            <include-prelude>/WEB-INF/jsp/base.jspf</include-prelude>
            <trim-directive-whitespaces>true</trim-directive-whitespaces>
            <default-content-type>text/html</default-content-type>
        </jsp-property-group>
    </jsp-config>
    

I don't think there is a Java API for that stuff. You can still use web.xml
with Spring Boot.

I think Dave gave a pretty straight forward answer - that is - there is no
Java API defined by the Servlet spec for configuring JSPs and if you must use
it with Spring Boot you just need to use web.xml which Spring Boot perfectly
supports. This sounds pretty clear to me.

Cheers.
