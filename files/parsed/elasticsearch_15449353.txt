15449353 Elastic Search data lost/erased/removed

I indexed around 50000 videos in elastic search, but when it reaches around
52000 , all data was erased. Well that was really weird for me, i had not set
any Heap size or min or max size memory size for ES so they were defaut i.e
256m min and 1g max and my total size of the document is 304mb. I have not
changed anything else from default as i am still like in a learning stag of
elastic search so any idea what could be the reason?

Thanks

Lucene under the hood is highly resilient.

IMHO the only reasons of such a deletion come from the user himself. Someone
on your Network probably send a delete command such as:

    
    
    curl -XDELETE localhost:9200
    

You should add more details on your configuration here.

  * How do you send docs? 
  * What does your elasticsearch.yml looks like?
  * How many nodes in your cluster?

dadoonet is probably right about the delete request. Another thing that could
potentially happen is if you were using the default data path then the
Elasticsearch data was being stored in the elasticsearch folder itself. If
someone deployed a new version of elasticsearch on top of the existing one,
then you would lose data.
