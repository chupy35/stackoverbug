25307791 elasticsearch upgrade from 0.9.x to 1.x.x

Can i upgrade my elasticsearch just by moving the data folder from the
elasticsearch-0.90.x folder to the elasticsearch-1.x.x folder, like this:

    
    
    curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_shutdown'
    ps ax | grep elasticsearch
    kill 11243
    mv elasticsearch-0.90.x/data elasticsearch-1.x.x
    ./elasticsearch-1.x.x/bin/elasticsearch
    

what's the best procedure to follow to upgrade from elasticsearch 0.9.x to
1.x.x ?

It is best practice to always keep the `data` and `logs` folders outside
${ES_HOME} in a different directory which will make your upgrades easier
(there is no need to move the `data` folder around). You can specify the paths
in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

    
    
    path.data: /path/to/data
    
    path.logs: /path/to/logs
    

When you're upgrading to 1.0 make sure you've covered all of the breaking
changes:

changes.html>

The best procedure to follow is the one described
[here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/setup-
upgrade.html#restart-upgrade) in the documentation, thats suits to your need,
according to the table shown
[here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/setup-
upgrade.html#setup-upgrade).

Moving the **data** directory could be sufficient if your cluster is very
simple, but we don't have enough information about your current situation.
