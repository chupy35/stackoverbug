15594749 path_hierarchy in elasticsearch

Is it possible to use the path_hierarchy tokenizer with paths that have
whitespace in them and have it create tokens based only on the delimiter not
the whitespace? For example,

"/airport/hangar 1"

would be tokenized as

"airport", "hangar 1",

not

"airport", "hangar", "1"?

The path_hierarchy tokenizer works perfectly fine with paths that have
whitespaces:

    
    
    curl "localhost:9200/_analyze?tokenizer=path_hierarchy&pretty=true" -d "/airport/hangar 1"
    {
      "tokens" : [ {
        "token" : "/airport",
        "start_offset" : 0,
        "end_offset" : 8,
        "type" : "word",
        "position" : 1
      }, {
        "token" : "/airport/hangar 1",
        "start_offset" : 0,
        "end_offset" : 17,
        "type" : "word",
        "position" : 1
      } ]
    }
    

However, based on your example, you might need to use the
[pattern](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-
modules/analysis/pattern-tokenizer.html) tokenizer instead.
