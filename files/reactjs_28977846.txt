this.refs no longer available in componentDidMount?
<p>From the changelog for React v0.13: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>"ref resolution order has changed slightly such that a ref to a component is available immediately after its <code>componentDidMount</code> method is called; this change should be observable only if your component calls a parent component's callback within your <code>componentDidMount</code>, which is an anti-pattern and should be avoided regardless"</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, is there a better way to access <code>this.refs</code> after the DOM mounts?  I dislike using <code>setTimeout()</code>, but that is the best method I see to work on a specific DOM after it mounts.  Is there a replacement method I am missing?  Or, is the best way to attach an <code>onLoad</code> method directly to the component?</p>&#xA;
<p>Maybe you are reading too much into this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My interpretation is that all refs to child components are available in <code>componentDidMount</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The change is that they are not available before the child component's own <code>componentDidMount</code> has completed (which happens before the parent component's). And you would only be affected by that if you call some callback from inside <code>componentDidMount</code> of the child, and that code tries to use the <code>ref</code> immediately. Which seems like an edge-case and, as they say, an anti-pattern.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So "normal usage" should not be impacted by this change.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please try and report back.</p>&#xA;
