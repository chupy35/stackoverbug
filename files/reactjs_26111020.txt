Use React with a non-browser JS environment
<p>Very open ended, apologies in advance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've been going through the docs and searching google incessantly, but I'm wondering what steps I would need to take to use react with a non-browser JavaScript environment.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Some context on the environment:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The environment uses JavaScript to run a UI, it has http capabilities.&#xA;There is no html, css, document, window, HTMLElement, etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The environment does have the notion of a hierarchy, changes to the object hierarchy in JS cross the bridge and trigger a render through a graphics platform like OpenGL for instance.  The environment does get input via keys and or a mouse.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If there's a roadmap to do this or something like an architecture diagram to refer to, that'd be fantastic.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any help/advice is appreciated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>thanks in advance,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>-dylan</p>&#xA;
<p>ReactJS work with DOM, so environment need to have DOM structure, that means no HTML no DOM. Or you can use server render of React component, but you will get a string as result.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Read more here:&#xA;<a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.rendercomponenttostring" rel="nofollow">React.renderComponentToString</a></p>&#xA;
