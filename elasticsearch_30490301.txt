Boost a query word in Elasticsearch
<p>Elasticsearch allows you to boost a field that you are searching on, but is it possible to "boost" the importance of a specific word in the query itself?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, I want to search for "Minnesota health care", and I want "Minnesota" to be more important than "health care" (because I don't want health care information from other states).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The closest thing I have found is using some type of <code>custom_score</code> query which allows you to change the scoring, and maybe I could use that to boost anything which actually includes the word that is more important. Not sure if that is possible.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Ideally I would be able to do this all programmatically, with a list of words that are considered "most important" for the application, and those could be found in incoming queries and "boosted".</p>&#xA;
<p>There are probably multiple ways  to achieve this one approach would be to use <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.x/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_boosting" rel="nofollow">query_string</a> where you can provide boost per individual terms </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Example below shows a query where matches on Minnesota are boosted twice as much:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{ &#xA;    "query" : {&#xA;        "query_string" : {&#xA;            "fields" : ["content", "name"],&#xA;            "query" : "Minnesota^2 health"&#xA;        }    &#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
