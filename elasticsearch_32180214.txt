After we upgrade elastisearch-1.5.2 we are getting java.io.EOFException
<ul>&#xA;<li>After upgrade elasticsearch to 1.5.2 we are repeatedly getting:</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>java.io.EOFException: read past EOF:&#xA;  MMapIndexInput(path="/iqs/ESData/elasticsearch/nodes/0/indices/ids_1/1/index/segments_7")</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>If we restart the cluster also the same exception is coming continuously. So we have one option left to delete the corrupted segment. But it's not the correct solution to our busy cluster. Can anyone suggest please.  </li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;
