elasticsearch: boost query based on values of a variable
<p>I understand how to boost query in elasticsearch depending on absolute value of a variable. For example </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{&#xA;    "query": {&#xA;        "bool": [&#xA;            { "match": {"field1": {"query": 10, "boost": 2}} }&#xA;        ]&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I need to do is to make sure the field1 influences the score but I dont know any absolute value. For example, document will field1 = 20 will get higher score as compared to document with field1 = 10. However, this is different from sort. Because sorting is absolute. I just want this variable to contribute to the overall score but this is not the only field controlling the overall score. </p>&#xA;
<p>The best solution here would be <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-function-score-query.html" rel="nofollow">function_score query</a>&#xA;It can be seen as the swiss army knife for customizing scores. &#xA;You can use field_value_factor function in it to achieve what you are looking for.</p>&#xA;
