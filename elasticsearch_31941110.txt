Is Elasticsearch percolate the right tool for finding predefined keywords in imported RSS feed articles?
<p>I am importing some RSS feeds from the Internet, and before indexing them in Elasticsearch I want to check if the content is matching some keywords. (Simple yes/no match) Of course this could be imlemented by myself, but Elasticsearch has some very nice features that make the search a little bit more fuzzy.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am thinking of adding a percolate query with the keywords and then sending them to elasticsearch this way to check if they are  matching. Is this the way to go or is there a better approach to solve this problem? I still want to use elasticsearch matching!</p>&#xA;
