ElasticSearch Tagline: How to Change
<p>How in the world to you change the ridiculous and useless tagline in ElasticSearch?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>'tagline' is not found in /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml, and when I add it, it has no effect.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it hard-wired into the code? What is the point of the dang thing if it can't be changed?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The intertubes seem totally silent on this.... just a thousand results repeating the same ridiculous and useless tagline.</p>&#xA;
<p>The same way you cannot change the tagline of any company (intellectual property anyone?), that tagline cannot be changed as well and is hardcoded into <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/c50b22f95f48119213156bdb634925e1be91b794/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/main/RestMainAction.java#L90" rel="nofollow"><code>RestMainAction.java</code></a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It should be merely considered as Elasticsearch's way of saying "Hello world".</p>&#xA;
