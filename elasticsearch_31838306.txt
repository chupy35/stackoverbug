Storing data as html within json or as json data fields
<p>I have some content that needs to be rendered as HTML, what would be considered best practice in terms of how the content is stored in ElasticSearch:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1) Store the HTML inside a single json field</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) Store the content as individual data fields, using nested objects with additional fields to indicate whether it is a list or a table etc and then generate html from this </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Just for info I am going to be using elasticsearch to serve the content and generate the entire UI from the data stored in the index.</p>&#xA;
<p>I would clearly go with option 2 as it's more flexible and you don't clutter your ES with plenty of HTML. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then I would give a shot at the <a href="https://github.com/tlrx/elasticsearch-view-plugin" rel="nofollow">Elasticsearch view plugin</a> to generate the HTML views out of my documents.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There is a comprehensive example <a href="http://tlrx.github.io/elasticsearch-view-plugin" rel="nofollow">available here</a></p>&#xA;
