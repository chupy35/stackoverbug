Using specific child components with a generic parent component
<p>Maybe I'm thinking about this in the wrong way, as I've only just recently picked up ReactJS, so feel free to correct my method of thinking.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I want to do is (theoretically) be able to have N specific child components that can fit into a single parent component, but I'm not sure how to tell the parent which child to render.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, I've written a tab container that just renders a content area right now. The content area would be the <em>parent</em>. I want to have N different types of items that can go into this content area. These items would be the <em>children</em>. Is it possible for me to use a single parent component and someone dynamically choose which type of child to render without going through the hassle of a conditional statement in the parent?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let me know if my question is not clear.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you in advance!</p>&#xA;
<p>I sometimes do this like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var Parent = React.createClass({&#xA;  render: function() {&#xA;    return React.DOM.div({}, this.props.childClass(this.props.childProps));&#xA;  }&#xA;});&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>or:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>var Parent = React.createClass({&#xA;  render: function() {&#xA;    return React.DOM.div({children: this.props.children});&#xA;  }&#xA;});&#xA;&#xA;Parent({}, ChildClass({foo: 'asdf'}))&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
