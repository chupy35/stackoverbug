Completly deinstall and remove Elasticsearch for complete restart and begin new
<p>After experimenting with Elasticsearch I'm searching for a way to completely remove everything concerning Elasticsearch on my server. I made quite a few mistakes and want to start completely new with a new installation. I hope this is not a too general question and will be useful for other noobs in the future.</p>&#xA;
<p>Simply find the Java process that Elasticsearch is in and kill, or use <code>curl -XPOST /*Your Ip*/:9200/_shutdown</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then remove Elasticsearch from your system by simply deleting the ES files/folder.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Various different setups could require different deletion methods (linux use <code>rm -rf</code> ES dirs, windows the good ol' delete button will work, logstash may require additional steps) but as a general rule it's quite simply to remove.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you wish to remove only the data you can delete the data dir, or wipe all your indexes and reindex.</p>&#xA;
<p>use the following command to know the pid of the node already running.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>curl -XGET '<a href="http://localhost:9200/_nodes/process" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://localhost:9200/_nodes/process</a>'</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It took me an hour to find out the way to kill the node and could finally do it after using this command in the terminal window.</p>&#xA;
