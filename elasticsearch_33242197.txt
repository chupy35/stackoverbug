is Elasticsearch is free or costly?
<p>Hi I just wanna ask is Elasticsearch is free or no. I know it is open source but I checked the website I didn't find any thing about pricing but I found subscription with no pricing. so is it free with long term of use or no?? Just to say the stack I,m working with is</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>MERN (MongoDB , Express.js , React.js , Node.js) and socket IO &#xA;if Elasticsearch is free is it going to work and integrate with my stack smoothly?</p>&#xA;
<p>Elasticsearch is free of cost and open source. They charge for services like support, consultancy etc. and for plugins like kibana.</p>&#xA;
<p>If you want managed hosting from elastic.co, they charge you according to several variables. You can find the pricing here: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/found/pricing" rel="noreferrer">https://www.elastic.co/found/pricing</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you want to use the open-source version, stand up your own servers and manage your own deployment, the code is at no cost and can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It's super-important to remember that spinning up VMs on the cloud is <strong>NOT</strong> free. In fact, you might spend more money on cloud VMs than using elastic.co's managed services. Elasticsearch is a memory hog and I found that very quickly, and with minor load, I had to dedicate 4GBs of RAM just for the Java heap space. Under heavy load, you'd have to dedicate more. All of that costs money.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As far as integrating with your mainly-javascript stack, it shouldn't be a problem. This library is very useful: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticsearch" rel="noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticsearch</a></p>&#xA;
