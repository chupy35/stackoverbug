Is it possible to make grand parent child query
<p>i have some relational data and i need to establish the connection between data along one level using parent child query. But then i need to establish 2 level relation as in parent child query. Is it possible using Elasticsearch and if possible what is the performance overhead of such queries. </p>&#xA;
<p>Yes , its possible. &#xA;You need to use parent child query in a nested fashion.&#xA;But be warned that this could be very memory intensive as all the lucene documents for the children documents needs to be loaded for grandchildren query.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>POST /company/country/_search&#xA;{&#xA;  "query": {&#xA;    "has_child": {&#xA;      "type": "branch",&#xA;      "query": {&#xA;        "has_child": {&#xA;          "type": "employee",&#xA;          "query": {&#xA;            "match": {&#xA;              "hobby": "hiking"&#xA;            }&#xA;          }&#xA;        }&#xA;      }&#xA;    }&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can find more information <a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/grandparents.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> </p>&#xA;
