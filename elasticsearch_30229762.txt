Stored Procedure in elasticsearch
<p>Is it possible to register query and call them by name to execute them. I am building an application that will let the user save search query associated with a label. I would like to save the query generated by the filter in ES.</p>&#xA;
<p><a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.x/search-template.html" rel="nofollow">Search template</a> is the answer to that question. You can register queries and pass parameters using this mechanism.</p>&#xA;
