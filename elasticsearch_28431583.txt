Searching subtitle data in elasticsearch
<p>Having the following data (simple srt)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>1&#xA;00:02:17,440 --&gt; 00:02:20,375&#xA;Senator, we're making our final&#xA;&#xA;2&#xA;00:02:20,476 --&gt; 00:02:22,501&#xA;approach into Coruscant.&#xA;&#xA;...&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>what would be the best way to index it in Elasticsearch? Now here's the catch: I want search results highlights to link to the exact time the timestamp indicates. Also, there are phrases overlapping multiple srt rows (such as <code>final approach</code> in the example above).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My ideas are </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Index the srt file as list type, timestamps being the indexes. I'm believe this would not match phrases overlapping multiple keys</li>&#xA;<li>Create custom tokenizer that only indexes the text part. I'm not sure how well can elasticsearch highlight the original content then.</li>&#xA;<li>Index only the text part and map it back to timestamp outside of elasticsearch</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or is there yet another option that would solve this in an elegant way?</p>&#xA;
