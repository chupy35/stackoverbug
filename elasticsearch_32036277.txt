enabling TTL on an entire index
<p>Question is pretty straight forward, is there a way to enable TTL on the index level. effectively means all types created under this index will inherit an enabled TTL.&#xA;on the documentation it is said that "You can provide a per index/type default _ttl value as follows", but I wasn't able to request TTL on an index level.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>in case it isn't possible, what workaround can be suggested ? in our environment new types are created all the time, and the data has to be removed after it is not needed anymore.</p>&#xA;
<p>You can accomplish this using <em>default</em> option under mapping. Under an index , if you put any configuration under_default_ it would be applied to all the mappings whose these configurations  not defined under the same index. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>curl -XPUT "http://localhost:9200/test_index" -d'{&#xA;  "mappings": {&#xA;    "_default_": {&#xA;      "_ttl": {&#xA;        "enabled": true&#xA;      }&#xA;    }&#xA;  }&#xA;}'&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
