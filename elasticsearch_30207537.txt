Can I import a snapshot to a new index in Elasticsearch?
<p>I have an index of 1 million records. Due to some challenges, I am forced to change the mapping of the index. Now the challenge I possess is to put the data from existing index to new index. I have gone through the<a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/reindex.html" rel="nofollow"> documentation</a> but could not use it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have an alternate approach to create a snapshot and restore, but I am not able to do it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If someone has solution to such an issue, kindly share it. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Chandan</p>&#xA;
