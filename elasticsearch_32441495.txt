Elastic search replica selection mechanism
<p>Anyone has information regarding the replica selection mechanism that Elasticsearch uses? I mean the basis on which a particular replica of a shard is selected to serve a query. I have tried to look at Elastic search documentation but I was unable to find the information.&#xA;Kindly share any relevant resource. </p>&#xA;
<p>So, I found the answer via discussion on ElasticSearch forums. To put it simply, ElasticSearch uses a round robin scheme to select replicas to respond to queries from within a replica group (sort-of). This replica group, according to my understanding, is selected based on the the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-cluster.html#allocation-awareness" rel="nofollow">awareness</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/search-request-preference.html" rel="nofollow">preference</a> attributes that has been provided in configuration. </p>&#xA;
