Is there a way to Set ttl in elastic search index
<p>I can  see that docs say that we can set <code>ttl</code> on a document but not on index/indices. Also wanted to know if it has any performance impact if we set <code>ttl</code>. </p>&#xA;
<p><code>_ttl</code> is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/mapping-ttl-field.html#mapping-ttl-field" rel="nofollow">enabled per index</a>, but the expiration works per document.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you want your indices to "expire", delete them. Much more simple and performant.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And yes, <code>_ttl</code> has a performance impact.&#xA;The Elasticsearch "way" of dealing with "expired" data is to create time-based indices. Meaning, for each day or each week you create an index. Index everything belonging to that day/week in that index. You decide how many days you want to keep around and stick to that number.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let's say that you want to keep the data for 7 days. In the 8th day you create the new index, as usual, then you delete the index from 8 days before. All the time you'll have in your cluster 7 indices. The <code>ttl</code> mechanism checks every <code>indices.ttl.interval</code> (60 seconds by default) for expired documents, it creates bulk requests out of them and deletes them. This means unnecessary requests coming to the cluster.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Instead, deleting an index is very easy and quick.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/time-based.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> and how to easily manage time based indices with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html" rel="nofollow">Curator</a>.</p>&#xA;
<p>Is TTL still supported in ElasticSearch 6.1 release?  Documentation does not mention it but I was curious if anyone tried. I do agree that using Curator and creating time based indices is a much better way.  </p>&#xA;
