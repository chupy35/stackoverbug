how to validate dynamically added controls in react js
<p>I'm new to react framework and I'm creating the components dynamically (textbox,checkbox &amp; select) and I would like to validate it before submitting the &#xA;Form. Can anyone suggest ideas?</p>&#xA;

<p>There's also Formsy-React:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It lets you specify your form validation logic without using JSX, which is a plus if you want framework-neutral validation.</p>&#xA;
