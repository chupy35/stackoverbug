Suggested elasticsearch configuration for a 3 node cluster for home use
<p>I have set up a simple elastic search cluster at home for testing and playing around. However, one aspect I am struggling with is figuring out a best practice configuration for my setup.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I currently have three nodes. A powerful VM instance and two raspberry pi's. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Up until recently the two raspberry pi nodes were set to both <code>node.master = false</code> and <code>node.data = false</code>. However, I would prefer to have more redundancy and make more use of my three nodes so I now have all three nodes set to <code>node.master</code> and I've set the <code>minimum_master_nodes</code> to 2.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question is whether this is a sensible setup for a test cluster? It wont be storing massive amounts of data or serving high amounts of search requests. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I would like to achieve data redundancy by storing the data on at least two nodes. Is this as simple as just setting one of the raspberry pi's as <code>node.data: true</code>?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks for any insight.</p>&#xA;
