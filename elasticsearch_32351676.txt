How to tell if an Elasticsearch query result is based on all index data
<p>In the Elasticsearch query result data structure there is information on the number of shards that were queried. It looks e.g. like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>_shards: {total: 45, successful: 31, failed: 0}</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does this mean that the returned result set is potentially incomplete (because 45 > 31)?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Why is the number of failed shards not 14 (= 45 - 31 = total - successful)?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In some applications it is particularly important to get a result based on all shards, e.g. when aggregate functions are used for reporting. In such applications it is better to have no result at all than having a wrong result. So telling from the result if it is correct or not seems to me like a second best solution. It would be better to get no result at all instead a wrong one.</p>&#xA;
