Get Score for Single Entry ElasticSearch
<p>So, I have a basic elasticsearch index that consists of 3 elements</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>id</li>&#xA;<li>url</li>&#xA;<li>content (text content)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know how to write a query against elasticsearch to rank the documents, but what if I wanted to know just how 1 particular URL did on that query. For example, let's say <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a> which had an ID of 2394823 was in the index and I wanted to know it's score for the query "search engine"</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this possible in ElasticSearch?</p>&#xA;
<p>Make a filtered query, looking at "search engine" in the content but filtering on the url value:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>POST myindex/_search&#xA;{&#xA;    "filtered": {&#xA;        "query": {&#xA;            "match": { "content": "search engine" }&#xA;         },&#xA;         "filter": {&#xA;             "term": { "url": { "http://www.google.com" }}&#xA;         }&#xA;     }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The only result should be the an element corresponding to google. From the response JSON, extract the score and you are done.</p>&#xA;
