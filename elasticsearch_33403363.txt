ElasticSearch 2.0 upgrade now can't connect to server
<p>I've had an elastic server cluster running for a few months now.   2 node cluster.  Pretty simple, things were working pretty nice.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, I upgraded from 1.7.2 to 2.0.0 today and now I can't get to my servers.... If I curl on the server using local host, everything works fine, if I curl on the machine using it's machine name, I get connection refused.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Upgrading is the only thing that's changed.   Any ideas why elastic isn't seeing anything when I use the machine name?  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks,&#xA;Nick</p>&#xA;
<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/breaking_20_network_changes.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> is, probably, the change in 2.0 that made the cluster accessible only via <code>localhost</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Update each <code>elasticsearch.yml</code> file and provide a <code>network.host</code> for the node.</p>&#xA;
<p>FWIW you can set the <code>network.host: 0.0.0.0</code> in <code>elasticsearch.yml</code> or launch as &#xA;follows : <code>bin/elasticsearch --network.host 0.0.0.0</code></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This way you should be able to access the cluster in <code>loopback</code> as well as <code>non_loopback</code></p>&#xA;
