ElasticSearch analyzer for German language
<p>I have a German word with umlaut, lets say it is "läuft". My target is to create an analyzer that produces three tokens at the end: "läuft", "laeuft" and "lauft".</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have tried different combinations with <em>icu_normalizer</em>, <em>asciifolding</em> and <em>snowball for German2</em> filters but no results. The best result I've got from <em>asciifolding</em> token filter that emits two out of three required tokens: "läuft" and "lauft".</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, basically, I need to create some kind of custom <em>asciifolding</em> filter for German language that will allow to emit additional variations for words with umlauts.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My configuration for <em>asciifolding</em> and <em>snowball</em> filters are the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>"ascii2": {&#xA;              "type": "asciifolding",&#xA;              "preserve_original": "true"&#xA;            },&#xA;&#xA;"snow-german2": {&#xA;              "type": "snowball",&#xA;              "language": "German2"&#xA;            },&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would be really appreciated for your help!</p>&#xA;
