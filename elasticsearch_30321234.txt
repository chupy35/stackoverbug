<p>To implement Alert when data match specific queries you should use the Percolator.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It allows you to store some queries and you can either alert or tag the document as you please.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>SEE : <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-percolate.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-percolate.html</a></p>&#xA;
