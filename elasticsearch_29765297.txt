Elasticsearch 1.5.0 EsRejectedExecutionException: rejected execution
<p>I'm Elasticsearch rookie, have a single-node cluster running Elasticsearch 1.5.0 on Ubuntu 12.04 64bit server.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>While doing load-testing experiments, I've noticed that if total number of shards in cluster is greater than thread pools search queue size, all search requests begin to fail with following error:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>org.elasticsearch.common.util.concurrent.EsRejectedExecutionException: rejected execution (queue capacity 3000) on org.elasticsearch.search.action.SearchServiceTransportAction$23@4cb7b956&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The question is: why do I need to keep search queue size greater or equal than total shard number? This looks unreasonable, as I'm forced to have very long search queues. :(((</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Maybe my bad? Would be grateful for any useful critics/advice/suggestion.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks!</p>&#xA;
