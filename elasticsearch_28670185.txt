How to allow requests to elasticsearch only from a list of ips/domains
<p>I read the docs, but I couldn't make it work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a server that holds elasticsearch and external ones that query it. Until now I can access the elasticsearch from any ip.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>the public ip:port of elasticsearchserver: <strong>123.123.123.123:9200</strong>&#xA;I have the domains: <strong>anothersocialnetwork.com</strong>  and <strong>anothersocialnetwork2.com</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>and I want only them and localhost to be able to query the elasticsearch server.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you alot</p>&#xA;
<p>There are multiple way to achieve this. The one i would like to advice is as follows - </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Run Elasticsearch in localhost interface by network.host as localhost in elasticsearch.yml file.</li>&#xA;<li>Now only applications in localhost can access the application</li>&#xA;<li>Place a proxy like nginx or apache and this proxy would be able to access elasticsearch. Now whitelist the IP's you want to access Elasticsearch in the proxy.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/sonian/elasticsearch-jetty" rel="nofollow">Elasticsearch jetty plugin</a>. It has some security configurations along with it. But i am not sure if its actively developed. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also on <a href="http://blog.qbox.io/getting-to-know-elasticsearch-securing-your-environment" rel="nofollow">security Elasticsearch</a> , i would recommend to go through <a href="http://blog.qbox.io/getting-to-know-elasticsearch-securing-your-environment" rel="nofollow">this blog</a>.</p>&#xA;
