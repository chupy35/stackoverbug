<p>There are multiple ways to do that.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>via HTTP interface, which means that you can run GET queries via your browser (Firefox, Chrome etc.) by accesing the proper url like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="http://localhost:9200/_search?q=tag:wow" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:9200/_search?q=tag:wow</a></p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Elasticsearch's <a href="http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/" rel="nofollow">HEAD plugin</a>. You can execute any query with it. It also has multiple additional functionalities.</p></li>&#xA;<li>Install <a href="https://www.google.pl/search?q=curl%20for%20windows" rel="nofollow">cUrl for Windows</a> and then run queries just like every tutorial suggests.</li>&#xA;<li>use any programming language like PHP that supports curl library.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Personally I prefer HEAD plugin since it has other functionalities that I use anyway.</p>&#xA;
<p>you can also check sense plugin for chrome. It will also help you in syntax for queries.&#xA;you can get it from here</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="https://github.com/bleskes/sense" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bleskes/sense</a></p>&#xA;
