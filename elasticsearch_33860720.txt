elasticsearch cluster status: Where are status changes logged?
<p>Elasticsearch 1.7.2 on CentOS</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Issue</strong>: Cluster went from green status to off green (not sure), and then back to green by itself.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Where are cluster status changes logged? </li>&#xA;<li>Where do we look to find out why/what caused the cluster status change?</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We are looking in the /var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log file. We only see errors related to java memory. We do not see any messages relating to cluster status changes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Update</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>From what we can tell, even though each node will return a cluster status (green/yellow/red), at least in default settings, these statuses are not logged (as a result, it can be very hard to know when the status changed). The logs do show errors, but particularly when a problem condition clears, the logs are (in our experience so far) not helpful.</p>&#xA;
