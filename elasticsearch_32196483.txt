Where to get Elasticsearch shield license?
<p>When I start kibana, I got the following exception:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>LicenseExpiredException[license expired for feature [shield]]&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I checked the document and only found that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>The first time you start up the node, a 30 days trial license will&#xA;  automatically be created which will enable Shield to be fully&#xA;  operational. Within these 30 days, you will be able to replace the&#xA;  trial license with another one that will be provided to you up on&#xA;  purchase.</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Isn't shield a free software? Where Could I purchase the license? I can't find it in the document.</p>&#xA;
<p>You can request for the subscription using the following link:-</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions">https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions</a></p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;
<p>I contacted ElasticSearch to know how I could get a license for a personal use. I just have a single server, and want a simple security realm (3 users : admin, logstash, kibana).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Well, the good point is that they called me back one hour after the form submission.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, the bad point is that they have no plan for personal usages, they just have (for now) a single bundle with everything included:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Professional support (ticket, phone)</li>&#xA;<li>License for every software (Marvel, Shield, Watcher)</li>&#xA;<li>Tons of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions">cool features</a></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Unfortunately, it fits perfectly for professional usage, because plans are about <strong>1600 $/year/cluster</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I told the support that having <strong>no plan for developer</strong> was a bad thing, but the only thing she said is "<em>sorry</em>".</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I'm heading toward <a href="http://floragunn.com/searchguard">SearchGuard</a> because it is free.</p>&#xA;
