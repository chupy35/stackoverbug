Elasticsearch is not running
<p>I tried running ubuntu elasticsearch at 12:04, after I install and run is OK, but i'm check <code>sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch status</code> there I see message <code>elasticsearch is not running</code>. and I tried to run in the browser to <code>localhost: 9200</code> also failed. &#xA;help me please..</p>&#xA;
<p>Did you try <code>sudo /etc/init.d/elasticsearch start</code>?</p>&#xA;
<p>It will not start automatically after you install it for good reason. You don't want it to accidentally join a cluster configured to use multicast discovery. See my post <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28556125/elasticsearch-jdbc-river-java-lang-outofmemoryerror-unable-to-create-new-nativ/28844094#28844094">here</a> for information on the basics for configuring elasticsearch.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In addition to that post, also make sure you set the following two options in <code>/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml</code>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><code>cluster.name: some-other-name</code></li>&#xA;<li><code>discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false</code></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>After you have done that, start it by running:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>sudo service elasticsearch start&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You should almost always disable multicast because on a local testing environment you only have one node so you don't need it, and in a production environment it's just bad practice since nodes accidentally joining the cluster can break things (trust me, I've had this happen and it's a headache).</p>&#xA;
