Installing Elasticsearch
<p>I try to index data on Elasticsearch, my problem is;after run the "elasticsearch.bat" command, I able to connect to the server, all process well done.but after that I cant write anything to the command line.Do you have any idea what is wrong?</p>&#xA;
<p>Thats Ok, you see the ElasticSearch console output. Just open an other console to make some input. Or start ElasticSearch as a service (<a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/setup-service-win.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/setup-service-win.html</a>)</p>&#xA;
<p>There is no command-line input available for Elasticsearch. You can do operations on Elasticsearch by REST commands (or with a Client API in for example JAVA).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can use CURL (application) to do REST operations in a command line.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can use the the internet browser to do some HTTP-GET commands. You can also do other REST commands (PUT, POST, DELETE) with some Chrome plugins like POSTMAN.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are some Elasticsearch plugins available to enable monitoring and management tooling that becomes available via the browser.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please read the Elasticsearch documentation! </p>&#xA;
<p>For all operations on indexes, mappings, querying, etc, the Marvel plugin has the Sense REST API interface which is fabulous. Sense is wrapped within the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/marvel" rel="nofollow">Marvel</a> plugin which is free for development.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It allows you to execute all possible ES API commands as JSON. We use it both as a way to prototype commands before implementing them in our ES client, and as a way to test very specific/boundary search scenarios.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are lots of other cool plugins to help you manage your ElasticSearch, some of which are described <a href="http://blog.florian-hopf.de/2014/06/goodbye-sense-welcome-alternatives.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Good luck!</p>&#xA;
<p>When you type only <code>elasticsearch.bat</code>, it means you are starting Elasticsearch server in the foreground, that´s why you are seeing real-time logs in your terminal and hence you can´t type anything.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, leave that unclosed and open another terminal (no need to go to the Elasticsearch directory again) and just type &#xA;<code> curl '<a href="http://localhost:9200/?pretty" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:9200/?pretty</a>'</code> but first make sure that     <code> curl </code> is supported in your terminal, if not, you need to use another terminal that supports it, for example Git Shell for Windows.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Afterwards you can use this second terminal to do your indexing.</p>&#xA;
<p>Via terminal with command curl + XGET (or XPUT, XDELETE, XPOST) you can send commands to elasticsearch:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/your_index' -d '{&#xA;    "query":&#xA;    {&#xA;        "filtered":&#xA;        {&#xA;            "query":&#xA;            {&#xA;                "match_all": {}&#xA;            }&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}';&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can also use the Chrome extension Sense, which can handle JSON configs (with handy history, nice highlighting).</p>&#xA;
<p>I think you have misunderstood something:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>ElasticSearch runs as a http service, that the reason why you cant still using that console. </li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Solution: <strong>just open another console</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, keep in mind you dont need to use a console, you can access it using any REST Client. Take a look at "Postman - REST Client" and "Sense (Beta)". Both are Chrome extensions.</p>&#xA;
