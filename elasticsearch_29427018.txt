set up Multiple clusters in Elastic search
<p>I want to set up two different clusters(cluster1,cluster2) of elastic search pointing same data location (UNCpath).  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Cluster1 will have one master and data node&#xA;Cluster2 will also have one mater and data node.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Both Cluster1 and cluster2 will point to same data location on an UNC path.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would like to use cluster1 only to handle index data request and cluster2 only to handle search request .  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can above set up be possible in elastic search?If yes, will it create any problem or issues having 2 different clusters pointing same data location.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The reason for this set up is because while indexing it consumes more memory and parallel user makes search request which slows down both indexing and search request.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have 15gb ram with 16 cores and data is round about 10 million</p>&#xA;
<p>A weird thought, but probably you can setup an NFS for your data folder , now launch two isolated clusters with the same cluster name . By isolation I mean they should not join and become one cluster. Then use one cluster for indexing another for search. </p>&#xA;
