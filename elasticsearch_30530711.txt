Broadcast get to all shards in Elasticsearch
<p>I'm using routing when indexing documents. In some cases it would be handy to perform a get without a routing parameter and have it broadcast like a search. &#xA;I could not find any documentation on how to do it except</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>Note, issuing a get without the correct routing, will cause the&#xA;  document not to be fetched.</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For comparison, the search API specifies:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>When executing a search, it will be broadcast to all the index/indices&#xA;  shards (round robin between replicas). Which shards will be searched&#xA;  on can be controlled by providing the routing parameter</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it supported or is there any way to achieve that?</p>&#xA;
