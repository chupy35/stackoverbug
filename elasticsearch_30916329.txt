Where does ElasticSearch store an index by default?
<p>I am currently indexing a large volume of data into ElasticSearch and I am not entirely sure where ES is actually storing the indices. My worries are that the indices are growing too large and might take up the entire space I have available on disk. In this sense, I would like to move them elsewhere (by creating snapshots and restoring them). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the configuration it is specified that the actual location of the indices is /path/to/data, but inside my data folder I simply cannot find them. Also, is it possible to leave ES in the current location and point it to store indices in a different place?</p>&#xA;
<p>The default location for the index is &lt; installation_folder>/data.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Yes, it is possible to change that value to something else, so you can have ES installed in one location, but the data will be in another. It is actually a best practice since it makes upgrades easier. In ES 1.6, its even possible for shadow replicas, meaning the index data can be shared by a couple of ES instances.</p>&#xA;
