Permutation of words in elasticsearch
<p>In elasticsearch I would like to treat documents as identical in the case where the values of a specific text field only differ by the order of the terms.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I accomplish that in elasticsearch?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Update, with a more detailed formulation of the goal:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Given I have five documents with the phrases 1) "iphone white", 2) "white iphone", 3) "white iphones", 4) "black iphone" and 5) "white android" (where the first three phrases consist of the two basic terms "white" and "iphone")</li>&#xA;<li>When I search for "iphone",</li>&#xA;<li>Then I would like only two results, for example "iphone white" and "black iphone" (such that I avoid duplications due to permutations of words).</li>&#xA;<li>The result that I want for each distinct combination of basic terms is the distinct phrase that has the highest score in elasticsearch for that query. In this example there are two distinct combinations of basic terms that matches the query: A) "iphone"+"white" and B) "iphone"+"black". For A phrases 1,2,3 match and for B phrase 4 matches. Phrase 1 could be the phrase with the highest score...</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;
