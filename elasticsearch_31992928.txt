Defining and using a Global "custom" analyzer in ElasticSearch
<p>We have created our own custom analyzer definition based on our application-wide needs and that is quite different from available analyzers in ElasticSearch like standard or classical analyzers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We have around 30 indices and i want to use this custom analyzer for all these indices. As much as I know and have searched, it seems that i need to include the analyzer definition in all the index definitions which seems like gross duplication of information.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it possible that I can define a custom analyzer once (possibly, without having to associate it's definition with any index), and then use this custom analyzer for several indices without having to redefine analyzer definition within each index definition?</p>&#xA;
