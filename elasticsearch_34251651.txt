stack overflow dump in elastic search
<p>I can see a lot of people are using stack data in elastic search (in tutorials). From where do I get JSON dump of stack overflow data that can be directly imported in elasticsearch?</p>&#xA;
<p>There is a 24 GB anonymized data dump available from archive.org.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can find it here:&#xA;<a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://archive.org/details/stackexchange</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Recommended is to download it using their torrent file:&#xA;<a href="https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackexchange_archive.torrent" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackexchange_archive.torrent</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can also read the original and official blog post <a href="https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-cc-data-now-hosted-by-the-internet-archive/">here</a>. And another interesting piece of info was the post on meta asking for <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2677/database-schema-documentation-for-the-public-data-dump-and-sede">the schema of that data dump</a> (it might be outdated though).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then, you can check out <a href="https://github.com/o19s/StackExchangeElasticSearch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this project</a> in order to index that data into your Elasticsearch.</p>&#xA;
