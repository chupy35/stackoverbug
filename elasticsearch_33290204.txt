How to get the total size of data matching query ElasticSearch?
<p>I have an ES query, that looks like this (I'm running it via <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sense-beta/lhjgkmllcaadmopgmanpapmpjgmfcfig?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Sense</a>):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>GET /asdf/qwer/_search&#xA;{&#xA;  "query": {&#xA;    "filtered": {&#xA;      "filter": {&#xA;        "bool": {&#xA;          "must": [&#xA;            { "term": { "some_name": "some_value" } }&#xA;          ]&#xA;        }&#xA;      }&#xA;    }&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This query has a huge number of results. What I really need to know is how much space these results are taking up in my cluster. Is there any way to get that kind of stat out of ES?</p>&#xA;
<p>I don't think this is possible in ES.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Maybe you can extrapolate by taking a look at the statistics related to your index, on how many docs these statistics are considered, then approximate the same for a subset of those documents (given the number of documents your query returns).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>GET /_stats/store,docs?index=test&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;
