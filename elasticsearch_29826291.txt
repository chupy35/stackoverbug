How do I do string search in Elasticsearch?
<p>I need to do string search in Elasticsearch like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>This is the content stored in elasticsearch&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>and I want it to match with "<code>content stored in</code>" for example, but not with "<code>in stored content</code>". Currently with the simple search both match. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also I want to match with partial strings like "<code>ontent stor</code>" (not full words).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know there are things like wildcard search, but they will scan all documents. I'd like to use features to have it run faster. </p>&#xA;
<p>Wildcard search are heavy. You can use <a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-ngram-tokenfilter.html" rel="nofollow">ngram token filter</a> in your analyzer and do term search. It will take care of matching partial string. Make sure that you use a different analyzer for search(without ngram token filter) if you are not using term search. </p>&#xA;
