<p>as in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/boosting-by-popularity.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/boosting-by-popularity.html</a> I want to boost my search result by their popularity.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>BUT I also want to boost the more recent.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I had the idea to combine this request with the one of RobMaters : <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12091365/is-it-possible-to-boost-newest-items-using-elasticsearch-foqelasticabundle">Is it possible to boost &#39;newest&#39; items using elasticsearch? (FOQElasticaBundle)</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have the feeling it's kind of weird to boost the popularity in some way (the fiels value factor function) ant the date in another (directly in the range query) --> Is there a "good" way to do it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>(if it is usefull I use the java api)</p>&#xA;
