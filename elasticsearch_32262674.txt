Cannot setup elastic search in Windows 8.1
<p>I am trying to setup elastic search on my PC (Windows 8.1)&#xA;What I did so far:&#xA;- Download ES 1.7.1 from here: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch</a>&#xA;- Install JAVA 1.8.0 and set JAVA_HOME variable&#xA;- Run the elasticsearch.bat</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I got status of "200" at first but now when i try to access <a href="http://localhost:9200" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://localhost:9200</a> or try to execute the elasticsearch.bat i am getting an error.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwnvb.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwnvb.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>&#xA;
<p>I see that you've put the elasticsearch folder in <code>C:</code> drive. Most probably it is your system drive and elasticsearch does not have permission to create files in this drive. Hence you see those exceptions. I would recommend putting the elasticsearch folder in a non-system drive and executing from there.</p>&#xA;
