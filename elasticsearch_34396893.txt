ElasticSearch Sort filtered results wrt number of matching tags
<p>I am using exact search with ElasticSearch and currently able to filter my database with multiple filtering fields as such:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My database consists of 4 person entries:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>{id:1, name:"Alice", hobbies:["guitar","football", "dance"]}&#xA;{id:2, name:"Bob" , hobbies:["guitar","basketball"]}&#xA;{id:3, name:"Jake", hobbies:["programming", "football"]}&#xA;{id:4, name:"John", hobbies:["cinema"]}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>then I query with:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>GET /mydb/persons/_search&#xA;{&#xA;    "query": {&#xA;        "filtered": {&#xA;&#xA;           "filter": {&#xA;&#xA;                "terms": { &#xA;                   "hobbies": [                        &#xA;                      "guitar",&#xA;                      "football"&#xA;                   ]&#xA;                }&#xA;           }&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then I get the results containing person entries having football or guitar  as a hobby.There is no particular order of results since i am using filter functionality of ES and there is no scoring.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'd like to get Alice as the first row since it has both of the hobbies. Is there a simple way to achieve this in elastic search?</p>&#xA;
